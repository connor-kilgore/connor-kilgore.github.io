Starting this week, I aimed to seek clarification on the issues I encountered last Thursday
with multi-methods. I ended up messaging Gina about my questions and received the answers I needed.
Today, I plan to focus on finishing up my technical debt.

First I started more work on my Component design presentation. I spent the first half of the
day researching, and putting together my slides and dialogue for the presentation. I now
have a solid understanding of the subject material, I just need to practice the dialogue
periodically over the next few days for my IPM on Thursday.

I finished up the day by addressing my technical debt. Needless to say, these technical debts
are becoming quite costly for 0-point assignments. I find myself a little behind schedule since
I still need to fully implement the database over the next two days. However, I see these technical
debts as valuable learning experiences that ultimately contribute to a smoother implementation
process for new features. In a way, I've been laying the groundwork for the database implementation all along.

Also, I forgot to post my kata video on Friday, so here it is!
