I woke up early this morning and thought I just get an early start at work. In the wee hours of
6am, I discovered the likely solution to this Speclj story. I found out that the old freshener library
kind of cheats. It loads in the spec files initially, but not the src files. It only reloads src
files if they are modified. This works for Speclj since the src files it points to are usually not
its own, but that of another project that it is imported into. By testing out this theory I was able to
reciprocate the issues with the new library I've had by modifying src files that contain atoms.

After discovering this I spent the rest of the day coming up with a solution. My idea is to just
follow exactly what the old library is doing. I'm unsure if that's the best fix since the old
libraries strategy just feels off for some reason. I choose to follow this route for now and will come
back to this issue if needed.

I hacked away at this problem for the rest of the day, I'm getting closer but likely need
another day to get this working properly.
