I kicked off today by doing some last minute prep work for my Prime Factors Kata demonstration at our weekly Lunch and
Learn.
I managed to practice it three times and I added in some extra test cases that Micah And Gina tested it on yesterday
that led to a stack overflow issue. Fortunately my presentation went really well, I addressed the stack overflow issue
and fixed it. People were impressed with the presentation I gave, and I was given good feedback. All in all, I felt
good about the demonstration and I can take that confidence into next week!

The rest of the meeting was again seeing some progress reports from my peers. Then we finished it off with a game
of my choosing because I was the facilitator this week. I went with [Gartic Phone]("https://garticphone.com/")
which seemed to be a hit for everyone.

On the second half of my day I watched a few Uncle Bob videos and then dived into my newest kata **Coin Changer.**
For my first time practicing it, my main focus was just to solve it, and then optimize my solution as much as possible.
I found an incredibly simple and elegant solution, therefore, I'm going to spend the next week getting fast at writing
out the solutions and tests for it. My tests themselves could use work on wording and possible cases.
