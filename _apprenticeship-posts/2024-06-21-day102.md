Today I spent some time in the morning on my bug story however I couldn't quite get it done in
time for IPM. I did however discover something that I believe will lead me to the solution for this
story. I learned that the freshening process I'm doing is resetting atoms in the system that are needed
for this program to work properly. As a result the whole system gets confused about which kind of
runner I'm using and where to look for the files and it breaks down. I tried to find the root
issue of the cause, but I need more time to look at this deeper.

Lunch and Learn ended up being a fun treat. I listened to a few presentations from some other
apprentices. Next we got into a game that Nick had put together. We ended up doing an escape room
which was a ton of fun, but it took us too long to get out, we had to go into IPM before we could get
to the end of the game.

During IPM my presentations ended up going really well! I passed with flying colors on the stuff
I got done and Brandon even commented about how he thought the infrastructure command confirmations
was an awesome idea. It's rewarding to come up with good ideas for stories myself, I feel as though
that is one of my strong suits at times.

The bug story got pushed another week, it is something I will put a lot of focus into. I did some
work after all my meetings but didn't get too far, I'll hit the ground running on Monday!
