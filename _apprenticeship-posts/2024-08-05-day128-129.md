I decided to put these two days together because I didn't have much to talk about on Monday.
Starting this week I picked up a spike story to investigate some front end lag that was becoming more
noticeable on Epic. This story involved using a profiler to identify the bottlenecks where the code was
spending the most time, so I could take a closer look at what was causing the issues.

The reason I put these two days together, is because I made barely any progress on Monday, and not
much today either. Part of the issue was Micah demonstrated some serious issues with lag on IPM last friday,
I was hoping to be able to reciprocate his lag, but I couldn't even get close to that level of lag despite
my best attempts. Additionally, implementing a profiler I found to be not super helpful after all.
I used a front-end profiler and react-dev tools, but they just weren't finding any bottlenecks.
My best guess is the lag is with reagent rendering, which I would have thought react-dev tools would demonstrate
but like I said, it wasn't showing much.

Tomorrow I'm pairing with either Gina or Brandon and I'm hoping they can give me some help on this story and I
can wrap things up and try to catch up with my stories this week.
