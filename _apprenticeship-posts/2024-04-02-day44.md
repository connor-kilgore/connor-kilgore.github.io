Today was all about my database implementation. I quickly realized that I had a lot more work
to do on my technical debt. There was still a lot of code that needed proper separation for this
new implementation to function smoothly.

I spent the first few hours making an argument parser that can take in arguments in any order and
properly understand them. This way, there are no issues if the user wants to interchange arguments
in no particular order

The rest of the day was spent working on my database implementation. I had to do some initial
research on PostgreSQL. I'm pretty rusty on SQL, and implementing PostgreSQL in Clojure is new
to me, so it took some research. Near the end of the day, I had my code properly connecting to
a locally created database. I played around with making and showing tables, but I also had to
practice my presentation a few times to end the day.
