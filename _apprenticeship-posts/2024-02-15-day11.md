Today was a good day! I had my IPM meeting and this time I was able to be fully prepared for it.
I brought in all my work from the iteration and did really well! It seemed as though Gina and Micah were both
satisfied with the work I did.

First I presented my Euler problems, they noticed the improvement in the layout,
tests and quality of the work from last week. I was given suggestions on using threads and tail recursion, both
things I ended up doing in Euler 12 later today!

Next I did my Kata which I did really well on, the code just flowed out of my fingertips and gave for a great
demonstration of mastery at my IPM. The feedback they gave was pretty extensive on this one, and I was sure to write
everything down. It mostly bogged down to making it cleaner and to not pre-factor my steps.

Last was my SRP presentation. The biggest comment was that I overcomplicated the topic too much. I went too
into detail on the decoupling strategies and communicated information that was unnecessarily technical. They also
recommended I add a personal touch to my presentation to be more entertaining for the viewers. Both are things I'll
be sure to take into my next presentation on Open-Closed Principle. We finished off the meeting by
planning my next iteration.

Given that I still had another half-day, I jumped right into my next iteration. First I watched an Uncle Bob video
on Use Cases, which I found to be quite informative. It left me a good idea on how to approach designing software
architecturally. I finished my day by doing Euler problem 12 which I managed to add in both thread-first and
tail-recursion to optimize and clean my code.
