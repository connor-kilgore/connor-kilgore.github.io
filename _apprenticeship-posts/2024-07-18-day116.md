Today was all about finishing up the retroactive todos story I was working on. I started by having the number
actually show up on the front end when todos are listed in poker. Now if I have 1. story, it's todos will be
1.1 t1, 1.2 t2, etc. With all the changes I made, this implementation was pretty simple and only took me
about half an hour to work the way I wanted it to.

Finally, for the rest of the day, I went back to Epic's end and got it to send over todos, properly
converted to poker stories on a link. By doing this I was able to fulfill the AC and have todos
be found retroactively by Poker. I am ready for IPM tomorrow.
