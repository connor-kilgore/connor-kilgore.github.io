Today I got to go to Micah's house to have an in person work experience! But before I get ahead of myself,
I started this morning by pushing my changes to production and syncing Micah's accounts. Incidentally,
I forgot to do the sync on Poker's end, so I ended up spending a lot more time today getting that fixed up too.
However, by the end of the day I had it finished and Micah's accounts were synced successfully.

As for what I did today, I got to meet up with some other Clean Coders for the first time ever today.
It was a great experience to break some ice with some people and get to know Micah better as well.
We had lunch together, played some basketball, and went out to dinner together. I also got to meet Micah's
wife, she was a very interesting person, she has lots of stories about 8th Light that are fun to listen
to.

I also got a confirmation from Micah that I start my challenge tomorrow! I'm very excited for the opportunity to
move to the next step and move forward in my career.
