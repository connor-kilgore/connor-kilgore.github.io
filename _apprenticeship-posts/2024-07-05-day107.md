Today I'm finally back from work after being off about a week. I had intended to start last Wednesday,
but I'm currently dealing with a cold that I picked up while I was away.

Today was IPM, I didn't do any points this week so really all I had to do was start a story until
Lunch and Learn, then just listen to what everyone else has to present. I ended up starting a spike
story for the Speclj issue I uncovered last week, unfortunately I want to get advice from either
Micah, Gina, or Brandon, but none of them are in today so there's really only so much I can do on
this story today.

Lunch and Learn was fun. First the newer apprentices gave their weekly presentations. They aren't using
power-points as a new challenge I'm guessing Micah made for them, so I like seeing them get creative
with the little they can use on just a speech for us. Afterward, the Jensen brothers put together another'
fun game, this week we did catchphrase. It was certainly entertaining to play this game with my voice barely
usable!

Later that day, the other apprentices and I started IPM with Tadd. As I mentioned I didn't do anything this
week, I mostly listened, but had a few thoughts toward the other demos. Tadd wasn't able to assign
us other work, but we have enough to get through Monday. We plan on pairing with someone who can give us
work next week!
