This morning I met with Gina after standup. I wanted to show her the progress I was making and maybe
get a pointer on the panel size story I was working on currently. She showed me that I could use this
new feature to get rid of an older attribute that is stored in the member schema and refactor a few things.
It made the story take a bit longer, but I was able to do the refactoring and have this feature update
working by the end of the day.

I also spoke with Micah today about a spike story for Speclj. I was able to find and prove a
pre-existing bug that was uncovered by my work on Speclj a few weeks ago. I however needed to run my
thoughts by him and get his opinion on what direction we should take to fix the issue that was uncovered.
Ultimately he said the best solution is to fix the route checking function that is in Epic, then move
it to C3Kit to be used by all other projects. With that, I had a pretty good idea for how to do this
project, and the estimate we would need for it, thus concluding my spike story.
