Starting today, I picked up a new story around a speclj bug where it doesn't see file changes for src files
in a directory that contains a space character.

I found out what the bug is, the url for files gets encoded when passed
through the java File object. The problem is the library Fresh is not decoding that url before looking for the file
path in the src directory. This is leading to it not finding the file at all, therefore it does not
update anything on the speclj vigilant runner output.

After I zoned it down to the library, I pulled from GitHub and started looking through. Evidently
I found the bug location after not a lot of time and managed to come up with a decent fix that
made the bug work okay. I wanted to confirm that my changes were working as intended, so I spent some time creating a
local jar from Fresh
that I put into my local version of speclj which I packaged into another local jar to use on an example project to
confirm my suspicions. After some fiddling everything worked great! Tomorrow I'll get this library updated and
update Speclj, so I can mark this story as complete!
