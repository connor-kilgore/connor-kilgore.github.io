In the morning Greg and I did a quick push to staging for Epic, otherwise I had nothing to do until
L&L later that morning.

When the weekly meeting started, we got a few classic apprentice presentations that were followed
by codenames presented by Merl, though he couldn't make it the day of. In fact the whole meeting
was pretty sparse, seems like the craftsmen are quite busy today.

When IPM finally rolled around, it was just Greg, Tadd and I, for the first half. Tadd isn't super
technical so while we get to practice demonstrating in layman, there were some things I wanted
some input from Micah on before proceeding. My demos went great as I'd expected and I got some
good feedback from Tadd. He seems interested with how Greg and I feel with our growth throughout
our internal work.

Once Micah had shown up we demoed a few things again back to him for that input I was looking for,
he gave us a great trajectory for the Jira stories next week. I'm looking forward to jumping into
them on Monday!
