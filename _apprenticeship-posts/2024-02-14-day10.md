I started off my day with again going through my Euler problems. I said I was finished yesterday but there was still
some touch up that needed to be done so that's exactly what I did. I am pretty happy with how all my problems turned
out. they are highly optimized, I removed unnecessary looping, and I was able to make my tests look great. I am still
a little unsure on the wording of my test comments, so I'll be sure to bring that into my IPM tomorrow.

The second half of my day I finalized my presentations for tomorrow. I have both my Kata and my SRP presentation.
For the kata I practiced it a few more times, though I'm more than confident in my ability to write it out
fluidly. My SRP still needed some memorization finished up. I ran through my script four more times fully until I was
familiar with the flow of my slides, the dialect, and the content I was presenting. Tomorrow I will ready for my
IPM.
