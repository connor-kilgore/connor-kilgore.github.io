Today I was determined to solve my HTTP_Server problem, I am incredibly satisfied with the
solution I came to.

I started my morning with another clean code video. These usually take about an hour to watch the content
and take the test until I get 100%.

Next I fiddled with my HTTP_Server problem for about an hour until I was pretty stuck. I ended up
pairing with Alex for a bit on Tuple, he gave me really helpful pointers. The solution we came to was
to use dependency injection. I've learned of this concept but never applied it before, I didn't think of
it until now. I set up my HTTP_Server to allow new response-types to be injected into it from the outside.
By doing this I could create an extended behavior from my ttt-web without changing the internal structure!
Doing this paired with implementing a java interface in Clojure, I finally got the behavior I wanted! I
could happily and confidently check off my HTTP_Server clean up story.
