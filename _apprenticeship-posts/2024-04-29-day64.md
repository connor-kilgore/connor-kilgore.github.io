Going into this week I feel fully reset from last week! I want to get my HTTP Server done the end of
tomorrow, so that I still have a day to focus on my TicTacToe clean up.

Today ended up being a pretty big trudge mostly because I was working out some refactoring to get my
server to work properly in the context of a library. This involved adjusting a few more functions
and setting up my ttt-web application to use it properly. Near midday, I got pretty stuck on the
reoccurring problem I'm having which is that my point of entry in this application is at the HTTP_Server
library, but I need to send that data back to my ttt-web application. I decided to pocket it for now
and put some time into catching up on some clean code videos I have to watch. That took up the rest of my
day.
