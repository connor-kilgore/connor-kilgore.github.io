Ultimately I have finalizing to do in order to be ready for IPM tomorrow. I'm finished with
implementations however I'd like to focus a lot on practicing my kata today. As I've previously
mentioned, it's a tricky kata to express efficiently and succinctly. I spent most of my day
running through this kata multiple times until I was confident with my memorization aspect.
I can get the kata working on memory without issue, so the rest is getting it done quickly
enough to not run too long while I'm demonstrating it. I'm fairly confident with my current
delivery and I plan to run through it hopefully two or three more times in the morning
before my IPM to ensure I'm completely ready to demonstrate.

I finished off my day by running through every story throughout the week one more time to make
sure I'm meeting the acceptance criteria. I feel confident with where I'm at, I'm ready for tomorrow!
