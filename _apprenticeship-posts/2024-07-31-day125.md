I felt good going into today having finished my Aesop story yesterday. It was intimidating, but
I got it done, it'll be a good demo for Friday. I picked up another story that was an investigative
story on some lag that Epic has around Tags.

I took all day but long story short, the issue with the tags was they didn't update on the client
end until the push-handler went through. On larger projects this appears delayed giving a lag effect.
I made the client now update on their end, and send a push update just to speed things up a bit.
I found a weird inconsistency with how the push-handlers work. Sometimes they get sent very quickly,
and other times they lag a few hundred milliseconds. This happens for smaller projects too, but those
few hundred milliseconds are more like 20-30 milliseconds which is imperceptible.

I also found that whenever a push is done, pretty much the entire project is updated which seems
wasteful, I want to see if it's possible to make updates happen to just the portion that was touched
instead to preserve resources in larger projects. Tomorrow I'm going to look under the hood of wire
and see if I can find anything out about these concerns.
