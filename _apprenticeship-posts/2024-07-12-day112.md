Today was our regular L&L, followed by Internal IPM. I started the morning by pairing with the apprentices
to push to staging. We found a minor issue with my migrations that got hot-fixed, then we were just
practiced our demos a bit before Lunch and Learn.

First we had a few presentations from our new apprentices and Brandon. Afterward we did our Friday Fun-time.
I was the facilitator this week, so I got to choose what game we played. I ended up going with Codenames
which has been a fan-favorite in the past with everybody.

After a few rounds of codenames we moved onto Internal IPM. There were no issues with the demos and everything
got accepted! When we moved onto planning next week, we started discussing the new "Weekly" tab that
would exist on Epic. There was some back and forth debate on how to approach this, which was fun to
contribute to. Once we finished, I got started on the first one which was the top bar design implementation.
I didn't get too far with it before the end of the day since I only had about an hour to work on it, but
it doesn't seem too difficult, I should have no issue finishing it Monday.
