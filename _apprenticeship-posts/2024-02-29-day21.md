I left today feeling really accomplished with the work I presented at IPM. Last week could have gone better
as I've likely mentioned in earlier posts. There was a lot of repeat mistakes I made that I wanted to fix after last
week's IPM. I feel as though I took a lot of advice and improved on it.

Going into my IPM, I was a bit nervous given last week's result, but I was extra critical with improving
my entertainment factor, being the ringleader of the meeting, and ensuring that my work is acceptable in
the parameters I was given. I ended up leaving the meeting with everything being accepted and not
having to have repeat advice, but instead new constructive criticism to take into my next week!

For this next iteration, I have a lot of additions to add onto my Tic-Tac-Toe board. In theory, they
don't seem super difficult, but I can tell they are there to challenge my ability to follow the
SOLID principles better as I continue to design my project. I'd like to refactor some of my old
code to better follow the discipline as I work on these new tasks.

For the rest of the day I finished up one of the smaller stories I had, which was just adding in
error messaging on invalid inputs. Then I had enough time to get started on my multiplayer
implementation which I intend to work on most tomorrow.
