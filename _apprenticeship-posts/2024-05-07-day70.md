Going into today I had one goal in mind, to watch 5 videos and pass all the exams for them.
I had about 10 left, so to stay on pace I needed to finish off my design pattern videos.

By the end of the day I had finished them, but needless to say they were very dense content.
I think there's still room to watch them over again if I ever need a refresher since a lot of it
was pretty hard to understand. However, I did get the general gist of each lesson in each video.
By the end of the day I felt pretty good with my understanding of the concepts and I plan to
try my best to implement these patterns into my code. But like the videos stated, they are best used
after I have an intimate understanding of them. I would like to look into getting the Design Patterns
book to further my research on the topic.

To finish off my day I met up with merl to discuss our presentation we are doing together. By the end
of our meeting we had put together a solid set of slides and dialogue for our IPMs.
