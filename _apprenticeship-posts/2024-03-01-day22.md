Today marks one month since I've joined Clean Coders. As a general reflection, I'd like to point
out how amazing the mentorship has been here. I can tell my ability to work and communicate as a
professional improves every day. The quality of my work has also skyrocketed thanks to following
SOLID principles and TDD. As I continue this mentorship, I will remind myself to always learn
new things and improve upon myself each day.

As for what I did today, I have a lot of work to do on my Tic Tac Toe project so that's what I
did all today, aside from the LnL meeting. At the LnL, I got to present on Liskov Substitution again,
it went well and people seemed impressed with it. Then I got to see other people's internal
projects for the week which is fascinating as usual.

I spent the rest of my day doing two things to my Tic Tac Toe project. The first was refactoring
my dependency hierarchy as best I could so that high level modules didn't unnecessarily depend
on lower level modules. The second thing I did was implement a two player option in the game, to
allow the user to play with a second user instead of the impossible AI. I managed to
complete the implementation as I write this blog post, but if I have time, I'd like to come back to
this before my next IPM to do some final touch ups and revisions.
