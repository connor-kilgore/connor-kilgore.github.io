This morning before IPM, my migrations ended up having some complications, unfortunately. I couldn't do a
hotfix before today's meetings, I settled by demoing on localhost, which is not ideal but not unacceptable.

L&L was pleasant as usual. We got some presentations from the newer apprentices and then moved onto a
game chosen by Olive. She ended up picking sets, the game that the Jensen's put together on a project.
As usual, Greg destroyed us at this game.

in IPM, the demos went mostly okay. I ended up running into a bug on the retroactive todos during
my demo which I promised to fix next week at 0 points. I thought it may have been some corrupted
data as a result of me trying to fix the migration this morning, but it could be some actual
bugs that need to be addressed.

After the demos we planned our next week of work and are ready to go. I didn't get a whole-lot done since
I had lunch after IPM, then it was practically the end of the day for me. I'll pick up a new story
on Monday.
