Today Greg and I spent most of the day on a confetti fountain story. I've been wanting to
try this story since I have been left out working on other stuff in the past. It'll be nice
to do a fun story like this as a breather on the story I was otherwise struggling on.

Needless to say, this ended up being a lot of fun playing with the animation and getting it
to behave like a confetti fountain. We had a really nice display by about midday which
put us way ahead of schedule on this story. There were a couple of optimizations we had to
wrap up, but we finished this story with no issues really.

For the next hour or so I focused on the bug story I made last week for the poker todos.
I found that there was an actual bug where it wasn't sending over todos properly under a
specific context. I hot-fixed it and couldn't find any other issues thankfully.

For the rest of the day, I focused on trying to finish up the story I worked on yesterday.
I had nearly finished but ran into an issue that I got stuck on. I paired with Alex J. for a bit,
he came up with a great solution for my problem. Though I worked a few hours over I finished
this story perfectly! It felt good to end the day finishing the amount of work I did this week,
I'm stoked to present my demos tomorrow.
