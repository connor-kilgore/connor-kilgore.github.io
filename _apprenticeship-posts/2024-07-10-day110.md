I started today with a clean slate, since I had finished all my previous stories up till now.
I picked out the next top-priority story which was to sort poker rooms like how they are in Epic.
Epic sorts rooms by most recently entered by the user. I thought this would be a quick implementation,
but as it turns out Poker doesn't have attributes for occupants to track most recently entered. To
solve this I had to add the new attribute and create a migration that works properly.

I'm finding migrations to be a bit tricky and often stressful because they can corrupt database data
if done incorrectly. Thankfully I am getting a lot of practice this week since this is my second migration.
After the migration was successful, I just had to copy over the same function from Epic and place it in Poker
and create some passing tests. That wasn't too difficult and I had this story done by the end of the day.
