The first story I did this week was to save data in Speclj to a safety file for the vigilant runner.
I had brought this concern up to Micah a few weeks ago because I found developing with the vigilant
runner was quite confusing when it's deleting necessary saved data in the files when they are refreshed.

I had to do a lot of tinkering to come to a solution but found a good approach is to just have the vigilant
runner ignore all files that have some form of save state that should be preserved upon reloading files.
Creating the function took a bit of time, but after about two hours I had something that worked pretty well.

My next step was to just go through each file and see which files break the whole program when they are reloaded.
Once I identified them, I put them on a blacklist that prevents the vigilant runner from watching them until
the program is entirely reset. Finishing this story in one day is a strong start to my week!
