Over the next week, my focus will be entirely on the Java HTTP Server project. Today, I dedicated
significant effort to refreshing my knowledge on the subject through research. As anticipated yesterday,
I found myself familiar with much of the content. However, I also needed to conduct new research on
making HTTP requests, which differs from the TCP requests I'm accustomed to.

As a reflection, I'm thoroughly enjoying this journey because the topic of networks combined with
computing has always fascinated me. It's enjoyable to practice and experiment with packet parsing
and sockets. However, as I approach this week, I want to ensure that I uphold the practices and
principles I've learned. This is my chance to dive into a brand-new project and preemptively adhere
to SOLID principles this time around.

Regarding the work I accomplished today, I concentrated on addressing the list of features I was assigned.
I successfully set up an argument parser capable of configuring the port and specifying the root
directory of the server. By day's end, I had nearly completed the implementation of the /hello command.
On Monday, I plan to return and tackle a few more options.
