Today was the day I really dived into implementing a 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe board, a feat I figured would
be the hardest of my tasks this week. So far that seems to be true. I spent a good portion of the day
rewriting my older code because it wasn't OCP friendly. What I mean by this is, a lot of my supporting
functions were only able to handle a 3x3 board scenario, like my win-checkers, printers, etc. After
a few hours I fixed those all up to handle any case without issues. Ultimately it forced me to come
up with much more elegant solutions that utilized lazy sequences over recursion. I found my results
to be quite satisfying. By fixing these issues, my algorithm for selecting the next best move naturally
complied with a 4x4 board. In theory, it works, but it is far too slow to be acceptable. The 3x3 board
takes a few seconds to calculate, but the 4x4 takes minutes or even hours to compute. Tomorrow I will
focus on coming up with a faster computation time.

Afterwords, I focused on my Interface Segregation Principle presentation. I started with the initial research,
it always helps to go back to the Uncle Bob video for reference, and also get some outside sources to further
understand the concept. Tomorrow I'll put that information into slides and get my dialogue ready to go.
