I ended up getting stuck longer than anticipated on a specific aspect of the file upload process,
which involved properly reading in the file data. When the data was sent through a POST request,
numerous headers were appended to it, requiring me to parse them out. Additionally, I encountered
an issue where the file size kept changing unpredictably after the upload, which perplexed me. After
experimenting with various solutions, I discovered that there were footers embedded within the file.
Once I removed these footers, the file upload functioned perfectly.

With some time left in my day, I dedicated it to last-minute practice for my presentation and
ensuring I'm fully prepared for my IPM tomorrow.
