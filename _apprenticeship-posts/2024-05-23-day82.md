My focus today was understanding Reagent much more deeply since I rushed myself to get this project
done before my IPM. I clearly didn't understand it well enough to be confident using it.

For the morning I took time looking at Reagent materials and tutorials to ensure I know how it works. My biggest
issue was I misunderstood the use of the render function and ratoms. Micah talked about this a little bit yesterday.
I assumed rendering had to be recalled each update, but it acts more as an event driven listener that waits for
updates in a specified ratom to update itself. It took some fiddling, but eventually I got my project restructured
to use rendering and ratoms properly.

For the second half of the day I got my menu put in for my TicTacToe game, and I worked on the board a little bit.
I am very close to being done I just need a few more implementations and tests for this project to finally be done
with the coding part. Afterward I need to put it on my blog to be a fully usable stateless TTT game.
