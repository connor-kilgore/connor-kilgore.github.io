Going into my IPM I was very satisfied to finally get this ClojureScript project finished. I've been
struggling on it for two weeks, I'm glad to finally hit acceptance criteria. That being said, my mentors did
have a lot to say about my project and the work that needed to be done on it. Particularly I fell short on
testing. A lot of my tests were big blobs that were hard to read and through this project I think I just forgot
about making tests well-written prose. There-fore a bigger task for me is to go back and make all my tests look
good, readable, and fully involved for this project. In total, they gave me 6 points this week to cover the
remainder of phase 3 of my apprenticeship. The remaining 4 points I'll receive on Friday for internal dev work!</p>

For the remainder of the day I focused on knocking out a bunch of small stories I have that are 0.25-0.5 points each.
By the end of the day I'd finished all of them, I'm happy with where I'm at before ending my day.
