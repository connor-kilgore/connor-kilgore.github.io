Seeing as I finished a story yesterday, I picked up a new one today. The structure of how I work is a little
different from how I would plan my work in the past. Before I had to commit to 10 points on the first day of the
week. Now, I still have 10 point velocity, but I pick up a story one at a time instead of all at once. It gives
me more room to choose what I am more interested in working on which I can appreciate.

Today's story was about having the iteration filter display properly. Fortunately this story really wasn't that
complicated. I found out quickly where the bug was located and found that the name overrides the iteration number
if it is set. That can be confusing if the name is contradictory to the iteration number so to fix this I just
formatted each iteration to be (Iteration #): (Title) (Date). here is the end product.
