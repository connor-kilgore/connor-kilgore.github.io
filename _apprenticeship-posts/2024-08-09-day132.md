I had a lot of work to do today. I ended up splitting stories with both Greg and Merl to work on
in the morning and afternoon respectively. Incidentally, we are all working behind schedule this week.
I paired with Greg in the morning on a Jira import story which we made good progress on but didn't quite finish.
He ended up staying to work on it while I moved over to the story I had with Merl.

Merl and I ended up working on a story to have saved filter configs on the weekly page. We worked up until almost
midnight but just couldn't quite finish everything, we are hoping to wrap things up in the morning.
I don't have a whole-lot of optimism around that however because there is just a lot to fix up on the tests,
the main functionality, and we still need to add in a delete feature. Regardless, I did try my best so I'm
just happy to be done with the work I did today.
