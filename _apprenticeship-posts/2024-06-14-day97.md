I spent the morning preparing myself for IPM which I was admittedly anxious for given my issues with Speclj, it
prevented me from getting all my work done.

Fortunately the meeting wasn't so bad, I just showed what I had and that was that. I will take this as a lesson
to very clearly read everything involved in the acceptance criteria so that I don't make this mistake in the
future.

After L&L and IPM, I spent the rest of the day working on a new story with Merl. This one involves
having tooltips for users be visible in the todo section. We diagnosed the issue but ended up having to stop
to do some infrastructure work.

I ended up pushing some stuff to production but had some issues due to some unknown reason. We got Jake on
just to make sure everything was working properly, and I'll spend some time next week to get this issue resolved.
