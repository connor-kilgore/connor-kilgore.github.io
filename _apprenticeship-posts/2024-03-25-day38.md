Starting this week, I have two main objectives for today. The first is to continue development
on my 3x3x3 board, which I expect will take most of my day. The second is to get started on my
Java Kata so that I can practice adequately before my IPM on Thursday.

For about the first two-thirds of the day, I continued working on my 3x3x3 board. By around noon,
I had finished the functionality to separate the cube into smaller 2D components. Once I had the
components, it was a simple matter of running each of them through the **get-winner** function that I
already had implemented and finding if any of them returned a valid winner.

The next few hours were spent on the AI implementation. It required a good amount of unexpected
refactoring, so by the time I finished working on the Tic Tac Toe assignment for the day, I hadn't
made much progress on the AI itself, but rather on the surrounding structure to make it feasible.

I finished the day off with my Java Kata. I ended up doing the bowling game, as it was the suggested
kata within my story. I found an example of it on the Clean Coders YouTube channel done by Brandon.
After a quick watch, I understood the rules of the Kata and started working on my own approach in Java.
By the end of the day, I had come up with a solution that I was satisfied with. It could use a bit
of polishing, but that's a task for tomorrow.
