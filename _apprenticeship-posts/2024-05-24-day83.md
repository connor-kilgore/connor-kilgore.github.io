Today was the wrap-up of my main implementation onto of my stateless ClojureScript TTT game. I got almost entirely
finished but there was still some wrap-ups I had left to do, I'm going to save those for Tuesday before my
IPM.

In the morning I got started on things, in particular I designed the grids for my TicTacToe game in the web-ui
format, I'm quite pleased with how it looks and the user-input is fairly intuitive.

Next on my agenda was Lunch and Learn, I was in charge of facilitating the game, therefore I spent some time
ensuring I had a game that would be fun for everybody. Initially I was going to repeat a game played earlier on,
but I decided to go with a JackBox game that I happen to own.

After Lunch and Learn I spent the rest of the day on my ClojureScript project. It mostly works but there's still
some things I'd like to fix up, as I mentioned I'm going to fix them up on Tuesday after memorial-day weekend.
