I started this week completely fresh to go take another stab at the story Merl and I were working
on last week. However, first Merl, Greg, and I got together to look at a new high priority story that
Micah brought up Friday evening. We did a little bit of work on it but needed to ask Micah a few questions which
he took a while to get back to us on, so we stopped our progress on it for the day.

The rest of the day Merl and I spent on the save configs story which we fell short on. I'm glad we took a whole
extra day to work on it instead of giving a much weaker demo the previous week. We fixed up all the technical debt
we had accrued and also added in the deletion feature. By the end of the day, we had an incredibly solid
implementation that we both felt great about to bring to IPM this coming Friday.
