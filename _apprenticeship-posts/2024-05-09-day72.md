This morning I was notified that my IPM would be pushed to tomorrow. I didn't have much to do, and both
Gina and Micah were pretty busy today, therefore I decided to just run through all my projects today
and make the quality of my work even better. I re-watched some design pattern videos that I still
could use a little more understanding on, and otherwise I ran fixed up my presentation with Merl bit by
bit.

For the second half of the day, Merl and I practiced our dialogue together for when we present at tomorrow's
Lunch and Learn. We decided to do a little playful conversation for our presentation which I think really
helps with the entertainment factor. We are both super confident with the quality of our presentation
for tomorrow.
