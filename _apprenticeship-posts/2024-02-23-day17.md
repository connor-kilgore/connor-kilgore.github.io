I started my day with a nice sandwich of working on my Tic Tac Toe project, going to IPM, then going back to my
Tic Tac Toe Project. For starters the IPM was great as usual. I always love to see what stuff people have to demonstrate
because getting
glimpses of internal development can be fascinating, especially the cloud platform related demos. I gave a quick
open closed principle presentation as well, I got good feedback and comments. At the end of it, there was a
card game we played which I found to be quite fun having a nice mix of strategy and luck. I might come back to it during
my personal time with friends.

Both in the morning and after IPM as I mentioned, I worked on my Tic Tac Toe project. The initial few hours was doing
some research and practicing dealing with different namespaces in Clojure. I'm still new to that aspect,
so it was a bit challenging, but rewarding once I started to understand! By the end of it I was starting to make
significant progress, getting my menu UI set up, and creating functions that prepared the start of the game. I'm also
making sure to follow TDD and the two SOLID principles I have studied. There was a portion where I initially
violated OCP and noticed it, then refactored to be more compliant, I was proud of that achievement.ls
