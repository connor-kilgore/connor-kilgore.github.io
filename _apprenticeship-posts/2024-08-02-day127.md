Being a Friday, today was all about meetings! The few hours I had before my first meeting I spent
prepping my demos for IPM. I put together some sample functions to demonstrate meeting AC on the Jira stories
I did.

Once Lunch and Learn rolled around we had a quick few presentations from the other apprentices, followed
by a few games of scattergories as Gina's pick for the weeks end. Once we finished it was onto IPM.
My demos went smoothly, and we got signed off on all our points! However, during the meeting Micah brought
up serious concerns with the performance on Epic for him. I haven't experienced the amount of lag he is, but
it might have to do with his big resolution or some other factor unique to him. Regardless, On Monday I'm going
to get started working on this issue by using a profiler to investigate these performance issues.
