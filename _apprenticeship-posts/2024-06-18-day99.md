Today I focused heavily on the Speclj bug. I wanted to see if I could make some good progress and
even get this story done. I didn't make the progress I'd hoped for on this story and was still pretty
stuck by the end of the day. A few times throughout the day I ended up pairing with Alex J. for some
extra help on this assignment. He ended up giving some good points and was a good pairing partner
to just help me think out this problem thoroughly and get some progress done.
