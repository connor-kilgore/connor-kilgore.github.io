Today, I had IPM, and I was pleasantly surprised by how my work turned out. Despite setbacks with my
3x3x3 board, I had anticipated that there might not be a full delivery. However, my hard work paid off,
and I entered the meeting with all my features working perfectly! By the end of the meeting, I received
good feedback on my projects, and everything was accepted!

In particular, Gina gave me lots of advice on how to make my project more polymorphic by completely
separating the TUI and GUI. Going into next week, I'll apply the same advice to how I'll implement
the database functionality.

I spent the rest of the day working on my technical debt. By the end of the day, I
had made good progress on separating my user interfaces. However, I ended up getting
stuck on how to call multi-methods in different namespaces, which I'll tackle tomorrow.
