I kicked off today with my IPM early in the morning. There wasn't any coding projects so the acceptance
criteria was much easier to hit than usual. I got everything accepted with no problems, which felt great.
Micah also suggested I share the Clojure Con 2024 research with Tadd.

After Lunch and Learn I decided to jump into one of my stories which was a presentation on Abstract
Factories. I did some preliminary research and re-watched the Clean Code video to get a solid understanding
of the subject. I wrote down some solid notes for Monday and that's how I ended my day. I'm still game
planning how I want to approach this topic since I don't want to rehash too much information from my last
presentation.
