This week I'm taking on a new challenge that I've been pretty excited to get started. Last week
I spiked a story with Greg for a new server that will act as an interface between Epic and Jira
to tell stories. To start this project, I got to be the one to start the server initially.

Starting off I pulled a template from the clean coders organization and started brainstorming a name
that I'll pitch this Friday. I ended up going with Aesop after a famous greek fabulist and
storyteller. The idea is that this project will effectively be a storyteller so the idea seems
fitting.

My progress was slow today as I was touching some new concepts with what's involved with starting
a new project on the clean coders stack. I had to figure out what I did and didn't need. I wasted
some time thinking I'd need a front end but later found out that wouldn't be the case. I ended
the day with the project set up and having a very informal way to retrieve and display stories.
I still have some work to do, but it was good work for day one.
