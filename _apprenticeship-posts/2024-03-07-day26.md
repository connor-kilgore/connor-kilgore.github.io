I had IPM today, and it went well! The state of my Tic-Tac-Toe board was at a very solid place.
I got some good feedback on how I should better structure my code, but I was also pleased
to hear that my code was readable. My ISP presentation could have been done better, I would like
to go into my next presentation sure that I've done more in depth research on the topic. Lastly
my kata had one critique, which was that I should make my code more understandable by using
lets to set variables that describe themselves.

After my demonstrations, I got everything accepted and signed off for the iteration. For the next
iteration I'm going to add a few more features to my Tic-Tac-Toe, make a HashMap on Java, and start
my first GUI kata.

The second half off my day went into starting on those Tic-Tac-Toe implementations, I'd like to
get those done sooner than later, then I can focus on the harder concepts later in the week.
