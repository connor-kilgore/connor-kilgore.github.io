Starting today, I had a meeting with the other apprentices and Brandon to get our work planned out for
the week. Last Friday we didn't have any available craftsmen during Internal IPM to get our full week
planned out, but we did have enough for day one. After about an hour planning, the other apprentices
and I were ready to get started on our stories.

The rest of the day I worked on a story for Epic. This story was to remember the panel size memory
of a member so that when the page is re-rendered, it goes back to the same position. Because this panel
size was for members, and not for the browser, I had to update the database instead of doing creating
a cookie to save the data. I didn't quite finish this story by the end of the day, but I can wrap it
up fairly quickly tomorrow.
