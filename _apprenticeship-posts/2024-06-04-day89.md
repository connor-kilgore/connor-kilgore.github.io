I worked on two things in particular today. The first was finishing up my last non-internal dev story which
was ensuring that my ttt-web still worked fine with the new tic-tac-toe updates, and also that it could
serve the frontend implementation of tic-tac-toe. This wasn't too difficult, I was done by midday.

After a lunch break I paired with Greg for about an hour and a half where he showed me a lot of the onboarding
process of internal dev systems. I got all the necessary repositories, databases, and access that I needed for now
to look at my first story which is fixing a label bug in Epic. After our call I spent some time just running through
all my other stories to make sure I am ready for IPM tomorrow, and then I spent the remainder of my day
exploring the code-base to get a better understanding of it. I plan to fix this bug tomorrow after my IPM.
