Today was a day of feedback for me. I had my first IPM meeting, and I got good criticism on my work
from the last week. Initially I was going to have this meeting next Monday so I was a little ill
prepared for some of the projects they wanted to see. I managed to complete all Euler problems which was
great, but I'm going to have to go back and redo a lot of them and clean up all of them in terms of
form, functionality, and testing.

I got a lot of clarity during this meeting on how my code should be written to standard. Yesterday I
was able to knock out a lot of my older problems and clean them up to look much better. It was very
satisfying work, seeing my work go from basically rambling in code form, to a "well written prose" as
my mentor describes it.

The last thing I did today was find a much cleaner solution for my Kata, <b>Prime Factors.</b> I got rid
of an entire loop block and instead replaced it with a lazy sequence. Additionally, I was able to memorize
the kata to the point of being able to demonstrate it in about 13 minutes time. I will continue to prepare
as I get closer to demonstrating it for real in the following week.
