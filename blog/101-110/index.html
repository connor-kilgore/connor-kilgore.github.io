   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   I started today with a clean slate, since I had finished all my previous stories up till now.
   I picked out the next top-priority story which was to sort poker rooms like how they are in Epic.
   Epic sorts rooms by most recently entered by the user. I thought this would be a quick implementation,
   but as it turns out Poker doesn't have attributes for occupants to track most recently entered. To
   solve this I had to add the new attribute and create a migration that works properly.</p>
  <p>
   I'm finding migrations to be a bit tricky and often stressful because they can corrupt database data
   if done incorrectly. Thankfully I am getting a lot of practice this week since this is my second migration.
   After the migration was successful, I just had to copy over the same function from Epic and place it in Poker
   and create some passing tests. That wasn't too difficult and I had this story done by the end of the day.</p>

   This morning I met with Gina after standup. I wanted to show her the progress I was making and maybe
   get a pointer on the panel size story I was working on currently. She showed me that I could use this
   new feature to get rid of an older attribute that is stored in the member schema and refactor a few things.
   It made the story take a bit longer, but I was able to do the refactoring and have this feature update
   working by the end of the day.</p>
  <p>
   I also spoke with Micah today about a spike story for Speclj. I was able to find and prove a
   pre-existing bug that was uncovered by my work on Speclj a few weeks ago. I however needed to run my
   thoughts by him and get his opinion on what direction we should take to fix the issue that was uncovered.
   Ultimately he said the best solution is to fix the route checking function that is in Epic, then move
   it to C3kit to be used by all other projects. With that, I had a pretty good idea for how to do this
   project, and the estimate we would need for it, thus concluding my spike story.</p>

   Starting today, I had a meeting with the other apprentices and Brandon to get our work planned out for
   the week. Last Friday we didn't have any available craftsmen during Internal IPM to get our full week
   planned out, but we did have enough for day one. After about an hour planning, the other apprentices
   and I were ready to get started on our stories.</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the day I worked on a story for Epic. This story was to remember the panel size memory
   of a member so that when the page is re-rendered, it goes back to the same position. Because this panel
   size was for members, and not for the browser, I had to update the database instead of doing creating
   a cookie to save the data. I didn't quite finish this story by the end of the day, but I can wrap it
   up fairly quickly tomorrow.</p>

   Today I'm finally back from work after being off about a week. I had intended to start last Wednesday
   but I'm currently dealing with a cold that I picked up while I was away.</p>
  <p>
   Today was IPM, I didn't do any points this week so really all I had to do was start a story until
   Lunch and Learn, then just listen to what everyone else has to present. I ended up starting a spike
   story for the Speclj issue I uncovered last week, unfortunately I want to get advice from either
   Micah, Gina, or Brandon, but none of them are in today so there's really only so much I can do on
   this story today.</p>
  <p>
   Lunch and Learn was fun. First the newer apprentices gave their weekly presentations. They aren't using
   power-points as a new challenge I'm guessing Micah made for them, so I like seeing them get creative
   with the little they can use on just a speech for us. Afterward, the Jensen brothers put together another'
   fun game, this week we did catchphrase. It was certainly entertaining to play this game with my voice barely
   usable!</p>
  <p>
   Later that day, the other apprentices and I started IPM with Tadd. As I mentioned I didn't do anything this
   week, I mostly listened, but had a few thoughts toward the other demos. Tadd wasn't able to assign
   us other work, but we have enough to get through Monday. We plan on pairing with someone who can give us
   work next week!

   Today was a lot of pairing for me. We focused on two stories today that were both pretty high
   point values, but none of us wanted to exceed our velocities, therefore, we thought it'd be best to just work
   on them together.</p>
  <p>
   The morning consisted of working on a render error bug that Greg had uncovered last week. This
   was caused by clicking out of the duplicate story confirmation model on Epic. It really wasn't as difficult
   as the story seemed to make it out to be. By late-morning we had found a good solution and
   completed that story.</p>
  <p>
   In the early-afternoon I paired with Gina. I showed her the work I've done this week, she was
   happy with my efforts! I also showed her the uncovered issue that Speclj has. Fortunately she told me that
   wasn't grounds to not meet acceptance criteria, it was just a typical side effect of changing libraries
   that are heavily depended on. I have a few ideas on a workaround that I'd like to share with people at IPM,
   but unfortunately I'm going to be out tomorrow for travelling.</p>
  <p>
   After my call with Gina I paired with Merl and Greg again to finish the other story. This one was allowing
   org members to join multiple teams on the Clean Coders website. Greg seemed to mostly run the paired programming.
   I helped until about 4:30pm but had to leave for the day. It worked out this way since my velocity this
   week is 8 instead of 10, so I just took less credit for this project and left the other two to finish this story
   up. By the time I'd left we were nearly done.

   I did one thing today. I finished this Speclj Bug story after my two weeks of effort. I kept working towards
   my strategy that I'd put together yesterday. By the end of the day I had this new library working completely!
   It also just innately fixed the original bug which was the space directory issue. Ending today on
   fixing something that has been an issue for two weeks was a big win for me!</p>
  <p>
   That being said near the end of the day I had uncovered a new issue that was caused by my
   changes in Speclj. Other projects that used Speclj were now not loading in source files in the
   proper order, specifically if those namespaces were referenced through file path instead of
   requiring them. I'm unsure of a solution and I'd like to talk to my mentor about it tomorrow.

   I woke up early this morning and thought I just get an early start at work. In the wee hours of
   6am, I discovered the likely solution to this Speclj story. I found out that the old freshener library
   kind of cheats. It loads in the spec files initially, but not the src files. It only reloads src
   files if they are modified. This works for Speclj since the src files it points to are usually not
   its own, but that of another project that it is imported into. By testing out this theory I was able to
   reciprocate the issues with the new library I've had by modifying src files that contain atoms.</p>
  <p>
   After discovering this I spent the rest of the day coming up with a solution. My idea is to just
   follow exactly what the old library is doing. I'm unsure if that's the best fix since the old
   libraries strategy just feels off for some reason. I choose to follow this route for now and will come
   back to this issue if needed.</p>
  <p>
   I hacked away at this problem for the rest of the day, I'm getting closer but likely need
   another day to get this working properly.

   I started the week by fixing a bug very quickly. I thought it would be an easy story and a good
   way to start my week with a win to glide me through my upcoming harder work. This was a fix to make
   it so that collapsed views on Epic didn't have scroll arrows below them anymore. All I had to do
   was not have them render when they are collapsed and fix up a couple tests to represent that.</p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the day I focused again on my speclj bug problem. I spent most of that time studying
   and trying to understand a possible solution for the atoms getting blown away when the files are freshened.
   I got a little bit of progress and understanding, but I still had a ways to go. I made some minor changes
   at the end of the day to test some of my theories but had not luck, unfortunately. Tomorrow I plan to
   pair with Brandon to see if he has an good input since he has done a lot of work on Speclj in the past.</p>

   Today I spent some time in the morning on my bug story however I couldn't quite get it done in
   time for IPM. I did however discover something that I believe will lead me to the solution for this
   story. I learned that the freshening process I'm doing is resetting atoms in the system that are needed
   for this program to work properly. As a result the whole system gets confused about which kind of
   runner I'm using and where to look for the files and it breaks down. I tried to find the root
   issue of the cause but I need more time to look at this deeper.</p>
  <p>
   Lunch and Learn ended up being a fun treat. I listened to a few presentations from some other
   apprentices. Next we got into a game that Nick had put together. We ended up doing an escape room
   which was a ton of fun, but it took us too long to get out, we had to go into IPM before we could get
   to the end of the game.</p>
  <p>
   During IPM my presentations ended up going really well! I passed with flying colors on the stuff
   I got done and Brandon even commented about how he thought the infrastructure command confirmations
   was an awesome idea. It's rewarding to come up with good ideas for stories myself, I feel as though
   that is one of my strong suits at times.</p>
  <p>
   The bug story got pushed another week, it is something I will put a lot of focus into. I did some
   work after all my meetings but didn't get too far, I'll hit the ground running on Monday!

   My speclj bug story wasn't progressing as quickly as I'd hoped, I decided to back burner it today
   and focus on another story for IPM tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   The story I picked up was on infrastructure. This is where we can access all the AWS instances
   and make any changes to them as needed. I brought up the concern last week however that we can
   execute commands without any form of confirmation. Those commands can extend to more dangerous ones
   like termination and stopping of instances that could lead to major issues. I suggested that commands
   that change the state of instances should include some form of confirmation that will prevent any
   unintentional state changes.</p>
  <p>
   This story actually wasn't very difficult at all. I created a function that would run a passed along
   invocation through a confirmation that would stop the invocation unless the user confirms said invocation.
   By the end of the day I had this finished and ready to present for tomorrow.</p>
