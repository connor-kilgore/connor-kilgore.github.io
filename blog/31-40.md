   Today was my last day before IPM, and I had quite a bit of work ahead of me. I needed to
   practice my kata a few more times, complete my Component Design videos story, and finalize my 3x3x3 board.</p>
  <p>
   I started the morning with the Component Design videos. I found them a little hard to follow,
   so I decided to review them again. Next week, I have to do a presentation on Component Design,
   so that will be my chance to understand this topic more in-depth. However, I did grasp the idea
   that it's basically the SOLID principles but applied to larger structural packages instead of
   individual classes.</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the morning was spent practicing my kata several more times. I feel ready to present
   it with no issues tomorrow!</p>
  <p>
   In the afternoon, I returned to work on my 3x3x3 board. At this point, my AI was capable of making smart
   moves, but it wasn't necessarily unbeatable. I ended up asking some questions to my mentors, and Micah
   posed a thought-provoking question that pushed me straight to the finish line. The simple answer is that
   the 3x3x3 AI is not unbeatable if the player has the first turn. Placing your piece in the middle cube
   guarantees a win if you can make the right moves. Therefore, all I have to do is make my AI always place
   their piece in the middle cube if they have the first turn. From there, the AI knows how to win without
   giving you a chance to beat them! Having fixed that issue, I was pretty satisfied with how I ended the day,
   knowing I'll go into tomorrow's meeting having met all the acceptance criteria.</p>

   Today was almost entirely dedicated to finishing up my 3x3x3 board. I needed to get it to
   a good enough spot to be acceptable. This was the part of the 3x3x3 project that I anticipated
   being the hardest. It took me a very long time of researching, refactoring, and tinkering, but by
   mid-afternoon, I had an AI that was smart but not unbeatable. Unfortunately, I doubt that meets the
   acceptable criteria, but I have other things I need to focus on before my IPM.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the next few hours implementing the GUI portion of the 3x3x3 board. It wasn't compatible
   with the 3x3x3 due to its unique nature of having multiple layers. Therefore, I had to give the
   GUI additional functionality to handle that. It wasn't too hard, and I like how it looks!</p>
  <p>
   I finished the day off by practicing my kata a few times. Along the way, I ended up polishing
   some code as well, which made me feel good about my progress with this story. Plus, I still have
   tomorrow to practice more.</p>

   Starting this week, I have two main objectives for today. The first is to continue development
   on my 3x3x3 board, which I expect will take most of my day. The second is to get started on my
   Java Kata so that I can practice adequately before my IPM on Thursday.</p>
  <p>
   For about the first two-thirds of the day, I continued working on my 3x3x3 board. By around noon,
   I had finished the functionality to separate the cube into smaller 2D components. Once I had the
   components, it was a simple matter of running each of them through the <b>get-winner</b> function that I
   already had implemented and finding if any of them returned a valid winner.</p>
  <p>
   The next few hours were spent on the AI implementation. It required a good amount of unexpected
   refactoring, so by the time I finished working on the Tic Tac Toe assignment for the day, I hadn't
   made much progress on the AI itself, but rather on the surrounding structure to make it feasible.</p>
  <p>
   I finished the day off with my Java Kata. I ended up doing the bowling game, as it was the suggested
   kata within my story. I found an example of it on the Clean Coders YouTube channel done by Brandon.
   After a quick watch, I understood the rules of the Kata and started working on my own approach in Java.
   By the end of the day, I had come up with a solution that I was satisfied with. It could use a bit
   of polishing, but that's a task for tomorrow.</p>

   I kicked off the day by diving into my 3x3x3 board project. With a lot of work ahead of me on this story,
   I needed to make the most of every minute available. Fortunately, resolving my technical debts yesterday
   really helped with this implementation because I had to refactor much less, and I was working with a less
   rigid code base to add new features. Firstly, I added functionality for the game to handle a 3x3x3 board.
   In my strategy, it takes in a vector with 27 spots and a <b>:three-d</b> flag.</p>
  <p>
   By the time I got that feature added, it was time for lunch and a learning session.
   I ended up presenting my Dependency Inversion Principle presentation again, and it went
   just as well as yesterday, receiving good feedback from my peers. Afterward, Micah gave a pretty
   interesting demo on using the schema library. Though I was able to follow, I found myself unsure of
   the typical usage of this library. Perhaps in the future, its usage will prove beneficial to me.</p>
  <p>
   After lunch and the learning session, I jumped right back into my 3x3x3 board project. My next step
   is to improve the win-checker to handle larger boards. Following the Open-Closed Principle (OCP),
   my approach was to first cross-section the cube into a bunch of individual 2D boards that could be
   checked individually. This feature took longer than I had hoped to get working. As of the end of the
   day, and at the time of writing this, I had about half of them done.</p>

   Today was my IPM, and I was very happy with how things turned out. The highlight of my demonstrations
   was definitely my presentation on the dependency inversion principle. This was one of my better presentations,
   as it was entertaining, insightful, and easy to understand, thanks to my easy-to-follow diagrams. I also had a
   very in-depth understanding of this concept compared to the other principles I have presented on in the past.</p>
  <p>
   By the end of the meeting, I received my assignments for the next week. In particular,
   the 3x3x3 board is something I have ahead of me that I anticipate will be quite difficult. However,
   for today, I need to focus on my technical debt. This involves refactoring old code that is deteriorating
   due to my efforts to improve the overall design. I have code in my tic-tac-toe assignment that dates back
   as far as a month ago at this point. Specifically, I need to focus on completely separating my user
   interfaces from computation code. Currently, my code is littered with UI checks, which make the structure
   ugly and rigid. After a few hours, I managed to separate things neatly to call the user interface when
   necessary and avoid Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) violations.</p>

   The finalizing touches took a while today, but looking back, I'm proud of the work I've done this week
   and more than ready to show what I've accomplished to my mentors tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   I started today by finishing work on my presentation. I ended up revising a good bit of the information
   and dialogue, which meant I had to practice some new lines and spend time creating new slides. As a result,
   this took me a little over half the day. Fortunately, I was pleased with how my presentation turned out.</p>
  <p>
   Afterward, I spent most of the rest of my day recording, voicing over, and editing my kata video on
   Langton's ant. I was really happy with how this video turned out, especially with how much cleaner my
   approach to the problem is compared to last week! I think it's very well explained and readable, which
   were both issues I had last week.</p>
  <p>
   I finished my day off by running through everything once more to ensure I am ready for the IPM tomorrow.
   I also spent some time on my Tic Tac Toe assignment setting up some tests that could have existed but
   I didn't make earlier on. It's challenging to set up tests when using a library that displays a GUI; I'd
   like to ask about the best approach to that when I get the chance next.</p>

   Today, I simply picked up where I left off. My main goal was to finish off a GUI and then practice and
   revise a presentation. Additionally, I aimed to reach a good stopping point with a kata, so I could
   practice and record it for a video tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   Finishing my Tic Tac Toe GUI took longer than expected, but I managed to complete it by about
   three-quarters of the way into the day. I encountered some unexpected difficulties regarding how
   it handled the end of the game, and there were some tests that could have been implemented or improved.</p>
  <p>
   With some time remaining in the day, I was able to revise my kata and practice my dialogue a few times.
   I still need to practice my presentation more before I'm ready to showcase it at IPM, but fortunately,
   I have tomorrow to run through it several more times. Additionally, I plan to complete and post my kata
   video tomorrow.</p>

   Going into this week, I have one story fully done. I'd like to practice my presentation each day this week,
   so my plan is to work on each of my other stories until Thursday. I need to implement a GUI for my
   Tic Tac Toe game, which I anticipate will take the most time. Therefore, it is the story I started my day
   with to hit the ground running.</p>
  <p>
   I worked on this implementation throughout the day, and by the end of the day, I was nearly finished with it.
   I probably could have finished, but, as I mentioned, I also wanted to start my presentation work today.
   I found that the most difficult thing about the GUI implementation is noticing SRP violations among my code,
   where it prints information unnecessarily. The function/modules' only purpose is to compute, not print.
   The negative consequence of this is that I need to spend time isolating these print statements into their
   own module that calls either a GUI or a TUI depending on command-line arguments.</p>
  <p>
   To end my day, I worked on my presentation. It's on the Dependency Inversion Principle, which makes
   it the last of the SOLID principles! Reflecting on the time I spent on these principles, I realize
   how much they've helped me improve. I find that the most common principles to follow are the SRP and
   OCP principles; I tend to unintentionally violate those most often. I spent the day putting my slides
   together until I was happy with them, and I wrote up my dialogue script to end the day.</p>

   Today I did two things in particular. The first is lunch and learn. We didn't present a much this week,
   but I did get to watch the craftsmen walk through a server issue. I found that work to be really fascinating
   for my potential future internal development projects. There's a lot of managing EC2 instances,
   something I am actually quite versed in, so I'm looking forward to the day when I get to take a stab
   at some internal work!</p>
  <p>
   The second and last thing I did today was saving game states for my Tic Tac Toe project.
   It was actually not too complicated to get this working. I needed a little research on how
   clojure does file io, but otherwise the implementation was straight forward.</p>
  <p>
   At the end of the day I got it working perfectly with my tests and felt good marking that
   story off before going into my weekend.

   I was quite delighted with how well my IPM went today. Everything was accepted and I got a lot
   of good feedback from my mentors. I appreciated that they took the time to tell me my work is
   satisfactory and that I'm doing well. It gave me a good point of reference for my performance so far.</p>
  <p>
   By the end of the IPM, we planned my next iteration where I got a bunch of new stuff to estimate,
   I'm set on material for the next two and a half weeks. An upcoming assignment is a 3x3x3 board.
   I originally estimated it pretty high due to the weight of my pessimistic guess. When I did the 4x4
   board last week, I took well over the amount of time I estimated, I didn't want to make the same mistake.
   However, on some reflection I realized the big setback for the 4x4 is shared with the 3x3x3, being
   computation time. I think my AI can already handle a 3x3x3 board in terms of time because of the depth
   limit imposed on it, so this assignment may not be as bad as I estimate. I'll likely lower my estimation
   before being assigned it in the coming weeks.</p>
  <p>
   I finished off my day by adding more tests into my tic-tac-toe board that were lacking. I felt
   good at the end of the day about that milestone because I covered a lot of functions that were otherwise
   untested, giving me new confidence in my suite.
