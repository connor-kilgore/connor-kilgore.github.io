 </div>

 <br><br>
 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
  <p>
   At Clean Coders, we strive to make our code as clean as possible. Clean code must find a balance between
   readability and efficiency. Ideally readable code is not always the most efficient, similarly, optimal efficiency
   can be at the cost of how easy the code is for other contributors to read. The best way to find this balance is
   to establish practices that can be followed and built off. With these ideologies, it is important to utilize them
   in all frameworks of code, including the more atypical ones like React.</p>
  <p>
   <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> is a javascript framework that uses the component data structure to
   create markup that is both modular and reusable. Due to the nature of the framework existing for a markup
   language, there need not be as much worry on finding the aforementioned balance. There is no presence of
   logic, but rather markup is about structure. Even so, React components should be treated the same as any other code,
   Conforming to a balance between efficiency and readability. To properly demonstrate an establishment of balance,
   <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> shall be used. This library
   "provides a minimalistic interface between ClojureScript and React."</p>

  <h3>What is the purpose of a component?</h3>
  <p>
   Creating a website will more than likely result in the need of reusable HTML. For example, it may be beneficial to
   have a navigation bar at the top of every page. Should the markup be manually rewritten on each webpage? Similar to a
   function call in a typical programming language, a component can be utilized to reference a predefined reusable
   markup. Here's a simple example of how a component might be reused:
  </p>

  <pre class="">
   <code class="hljs">
== BEFORE ==

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">barn</span> []
 [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
  [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This barn contains"</span>]
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
    ... animal markup ...
    [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> <span class="hljs-string">"cows"</span>]]
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
    ... animal markup ...
    [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> <span class="hljs-string">"sheep"</span>]]])
   </code>
  </pre>

 <pre class="ml-5">
   <code class="hljs">
== AFTER ==

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">animals</span> [name]
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
    ... animal markup ...
    [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> name]])

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">barn</span> []
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
   [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This barn contains"</span>]
   (<span class="hljs-keyword">animals</span> <span class="hljs-string">"cows"</span>)
   (<span class="hljs-keyword">animals</span> <span class="hljs-string">"sheep"</span>)])
   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   In this case, the before markup shows most of the cows and sheep divs being rewritten, the after places them into
   separate functions to be reused without any unnecessary redundancy. Now when referring to the scale
   of balance, the only factor involved is readability. This is because the barn component is not affected by state
   change and is therefore static. Choosing between the before and after solely comes down to what is deemed more
   readable. Using a simpler div for animals would make the before example the go to, while a more complex div for
   animals would justify the after example where the rewritten code is extracted.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">

  <h3>Decoupling components from each other</h3>
  <p>
   Next is the fun part. When creating a front-end that allows user interaction, it will need to
   update the rendered markup in some shape or form. Reagent is great at accomplishing this through the use of
   <b> reagent-atoms (ratoms)</b> and <b>reagent-trackers</b>. For example, the number of cows that are present
   could be incremented with the use of a button:
  </p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">barn</span> []
 (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> [cow-num (<span class="hljs-keyword">r/atom</span> 0)]
   (<span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> []
     [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
      [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This barn contains"</span>]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span> [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">str</span> @cow-num " cows")]]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:button</span> {<span class="hljs-name">:on-click</span> #(<span class="hljs-keyword">swap!</span> cow-num inc)} <span class="hljs-string">"Add"</span>]])))
   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   Each click of the button will update the ratom, which subsequently re-renders any component that uses it.
   Because of how the barn component is set up, it is coupled to cows. Any changes to cows will force barn to
   be entirely re-rendered, this is a
   <b>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b> violation. Now with this example, it is an inexpensive render,
   but as barn grows in complexity
   with its nested elements, the cost of this coupling will continue to rise. Here is where the first crossroads
   between performance and readability appear. On one hand, performance can be prioritized at the cost
   that this code will be less clear for collaborators to understand. On the other, focusing readability could lead to
   future performance issues that are difficult to find. Generally, it is good practice to decide which road to take
   based on anticipated future cost of this component. While barn may stay relatively small and inexpensive, cows could
   be represented by hundreds of rendered divs to represent each cow. Having this expectation leads to the conclusion
   that performance needs to take priority over readability. To do so, cows is extracted into its own component using
   the earlier animals function:</p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">animals</span> [name]
  (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> [num (<span class="hljs-keyword">r/atom</span> 0)]
    (<span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> []
      [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span> [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">str</span> @num " " name)]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:button</span> {<span class="hljs-name">:on-click</span> #(<span class="hljs-keyword">swap!</span> num inc)} <span class="hljs-string">"Add"</span>]])))

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">barn</span> []
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
   [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This barn contains"</span>]
   [animals <span class="hljs-string">"cows"</span>]])
   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   With this change, any increments of cows will only rerender cows, barn will remain unaffected by any state changes.
   Similarly, sheep can be reintroduced as their own component. Any state changes on sheep will neither affect
   barn nor cows, only sheep.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
  <h3>What's the deal with inner-functions?</h3>

  <p>
   From the previous examples, the use of inner-functions has appeared, what is the purpose of them? How are they used?
   Don't be alarmed by the inner nested function-it distinguishes the part of the component that should run only
   once from the part that should update in response to state changes. Had the inner function in the animals
   component not been used, cows would be unable to properly increment. Take this example without the inner-function:
   </p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
== THIS WILL NOT WORK ==

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">animals</span> [name]
  (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> [num (<span class="hljs-keyword">r/atom</span> 0)]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span> [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">str</span> @num " " name)]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:button</span> {<span class="hljs-name">:on-click</span> #(<span class="hljs-keyword">swap!</span> num inc)} <span class="hljs-string">"Add"</span>]]))
   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   Each time the button to add a new animal is clicked, the entire function would be run again. This is because a ratom
   that is used in the component is updated, Reagent components are reactive, therefore they update in response to
   state change. Without the inner-function to act as a partition between the run-once and the run-on-change behavior,
   the animals component will proceed to re-initialize the ratom at zero.
   With the use of the inner-function, the animals component now knows to only initialize the ratom on the first time
   the component is rendered. Every subsequent rendering will only affect the code that exists within the inner
   function, allowing the incrementing to take effect.
  </p>
 </div>

 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
  <h3>[] vs (): What's the difference?</h3>

  <p>
   Now that inner-functions have been clarified, the difference between brackets and parenthesis must be understood
   as well. When defining a function to be used in a component, it can be called in one of two ways.
   <br>
   <b>1.</b> Square brackets "<b>[]</b>", which is a traditional way of treating the function
   as a reactive component. By creating a component, the structure of the newly created component will become
   decoupled from the parent component that it presides in. i.e. animals will decouple from barn.
   <br>
   <b>2.</b> Parenthesis "<b>()</b>". When a Reagent function is called with (), it is logically the same as just
   nesting the code in the higher level component. Using () is meant for reusing static markup that would not change
   how it is rendered from any state changes. Following the examples so far, barn may contain a hay bale that
   does not change in quantity like animals, therefore it will always be a hay bale.
  </p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">animals</span> [name]
  (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> [num (<span class="hljs-keyword">r/atom</span> 0)]
    (<span class="hljs-keyword">fn</span> []
      [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span> [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">str</span> @num " " name)]
      [<span class="hljs-name">:button</span> {<span class="hljs-name">:on-click</span> #(<span class="hljs-keyword">swap!</span> num inc)} <span class="hljs-string">"Add"</span>]])))

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">hay-bale</span> []
 [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> <span class="hljs-string">"a hay bale"</span>])

(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">barn</span> []
  [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span>
   [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This barn contains"</span>]
   (<span class="hljs-title">hay-bale</span>)
   [animals <span class="hljs-string">"cows"</span>]])
   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   Unlike components, calling functions with () does not provide any potential boost in performance, therefore this
   extraction of hay-bale only has a negative effect of making the code harder to read. Typically, the use of ()
   will occur during refactoring; once it is discovered that hay-bale could be reusable in other components, extracting
   it out will become useful. This is also under the assumption that hay-bale is more complex than a simple h3
   element.</p>

  <p>
   Understanding the difference between [] and () becomes important because misuse of them can lead to decreasing
   performance without increasing readability whatsoever. If the implementation of cows is reorganized such that the
   ratom is passed into the cows function, the same behavior can be achieved through either [] or (). However,
   in this scenario, calling the cows function will rerender barn if through (), and will not if through [].
  </p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
(<span class="hljs-keyword">defn</span> <span class="hljs-title">cows</span> [num]
 [<span class="hljs-name">:div</span> [<span class="hljs-name">:h3</span> (<span class="hljs-title">str</span> @num <span class="hljs-string">" cows"</span>)]])

      [<span class="hljs-name">:h2</span> "This barn contains"]
      [cows cow-num]

   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   In cases like this, there is no downside to choosing the optimal method for how to structure these components.
  </p>

 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
  <h3>When to use reagent-trackers</h3>

  <p>
   Reagent trackers work very similarly to ratoms where they can be the catalyst for a component to rerender.
   Where they differ from ratoms is they are two layers deep, while a ratom is one. What that means is a ratom
   directly stores information; upon update of the ratom, any components with a dereference to it update. Trackers on
   the other act almost like a component themselves, they contain a function that dereferences a ratom, that return
   value is updated when the state of the ratom changes. Therefore, a component is updated when it contains
   a dereference of a tracker that contains a dereference of a ratom that updates.</p>
  <p>
   Trackers are advantageous for both performance and readability. First they are able to set fields to not obvious
   function returns. For example, a tracker could be named second-cows-name that holds the field for the second
   existing cows name, this can be incredibly helpful for collaborators to understand the intentions of what is being
   rendered. When talking about performance, trackers can prevent unnecessary re-renders. Consider the
   following example where the first animal in a list is tracked with a ratom.</p>

  <pre>
   <code class="hljs">
== ANIMAL RE-RENDERS EACH BUTTON PRESS ==

   </code>

   </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
   The ratom is always changing value whenever the button is pressed. However, by restructuring the component to
   use a tracker that watches the first animal in the animal list, the animal component is not re-rendered
   each subsequent time the button is pressed, this is an optimized logic. The reason this behavior occurs, is because
   re-renders only occur when the dereferenced value in a component changes. The first animal in the list
   will always remain the same after each button click, therefore the dereferenced tracker stays the same.
  </p>

  </div>

 <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
  <h3>Concluding Arguments</h3>
  <p>
   When designing a Reagent layout, it is critical to be strategic about where data is passed, and how
   components are extracted from each other. Balancing readability and performance can be tricky and oftentimes
   comes down to personal judgement, but an informed coder will design the better system. When designing
   for readability, consider who the collaborators are. Are they all coders? Are there UX designers who may have
   less understanding of code? Heavily extracting functions will make it difficult to follow for others, and typically
   gains little to no optimization. When designing for performance, anticipate the cost, or future cost of a component.
   Will this component be rendered many times? Will this component grow in complexity? Sometimes these questions are
   hard to answer, a system can be vastly different when developed for years longer. Know the system, understand which
   elements appear complex, and which ones appear commonly. When front-end performance becomes noticeably slower,
   an informed Reagent user will know how to make a list of suspects to refactor.
