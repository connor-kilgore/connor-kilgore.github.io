   Today I put all my focus into my ClojureScript TTT implementation. I had a decent start in the morning because I
   resolved a few lingering issues with my setup, however they took up more time than I'd hoped throughout the day
   seeing as I only have until tomorrow to get this done.</p>
  <p>
   Those issues included trying to get Reagent imported into my system properly, and having a proper run file instead
   of just a dev file for testing. I took a wrong turn with Reagent and ended up wasting some extra time but by
   midday I had everything working.</p>
  <p>
   In the afternoon I ended up finding out how involved Reagent can be for this project. I hacked at getting the new
   UI working for the rest of the day, but I just didn't finish on time, I had to let my Mentors know of my situation.
   I think where I went wrong was I thought I could use the UI synchronously with my program like the TUI performs, but
   JavaScript, and therefore ClojureScript is inherently asynchronous. If I had another day or two to rethink
   and refactor my strategy I could get this program finally complete. For now I'll show them what I have at IPM
   tomorrow.

   I've a fresh week ahead of me. I don't have as many days this week to hit my quota since my IPM was permanently
   moved to Wednesdays on account of the two new apprentices. I can't really complain since I only have 4 points this
   week.</p>
  <p>
   Early this morning I finally fully fixed my issues with the ClojureScript project set up! It's been a long and
   gruelling task between Gina and me. Our combined efforts paid off! I was proud to share that information with
   her and I think it will reflect well on how I present this project to her and Micah on Wednesday.</p>
  <p>
   Afterward I got into the supposed meat of this project which was getting the stateless TicTacToe game
   running on my website. Today to accomplish this I focused on integrating my project into .cljc files.
   I have a good grasp on what does and doesn't need to be a .cljc file. It really comes down to if the file is
   usable for both frontend and backend, then it should be a .cljc file. I accomplished this by adding in my
   TicTacToe files one by one getting each one to work starting from the most concrete classes up to the more
   abstract ones. By the end of it all I had my project fully working as both a ClojureScript and Clojure
   version!</p>
  <p>
   Tomorrow all I have to do is implement my new ui for the ClojureScript implementation, then I'm ready for my IPM.
   I'm hoping I can get this done early so that I have some time to really make sure everything looks good for Wednesday.

   Starting my next iteration fresh I started this morning with some last minute practice on my presentation
   for lunch and learn today. I revised a few things just before presenting, but that fortunately wasn't
   a problem.</p>
  <p>
   Today during lunch and learn I got to meet the now newest apprentice Michael, also known as Scoops.
   He seems like a nice guy and I look forward to getting to know him better as he continues his
   journey at Clean Coders.</p>
  <p>
   For our game this week we did a spy game which I found quite fun! I think I've played it in the past,
   but it's been a long time, it was a nice throw-back for me.</p>
  <p>
   After Lunch and Learn and a short lunch break I focused on my continued issue the ClojureScript project,
   I'm happy to say I made good progress and actually got stuff compiling today! I'm hoping on Monday I can
   wrap up these issues and focus on the implementation finally.</p>

   I went into IPM today knowing that I didn't have something done, but as I mentioned previously,
   I've been fairly open about this being difficult so fortunately at least me being behind wasn't
   a surprise.</p>
  <p>
   Micah was held back in another meeting, so it was just me and Gina, we spent a good while pairing trying
   to resolve some of the major issues I've been dealing with so that I can get this story done and working
   properly.</p>
  <p>
   After we finished pairing I took a lunch break then jumped into a call with the new apprentice Alex
   to say hi. He works in a sun-room in his home which compared to my often dimly lit studio apartment,
   makes me jealous.</p>
  <p>
   After talking to Alex I did some work on my ClojureScript story to try and start fresh, Gina recommended
   I just start with a Hello World project and build my way up so that I'm not encountering major amounts
   of errors at once.</p>
  <p>
   I finished my day by pairing with Merl, so we could give each other pointers on our presentations that we
   are presenting tomorrow. We cover the same topics, but we took different approaches on what information
   we wanted to convey, I think it will really help make our presentations not monotonous at Lunch and
   Learn tomorrow.

   Today was my collaborative effort to try and get going on this ClojureScript story. Despite everything
   I wasn't very successful, but I'm still glad I gave it my best shot and was open and honest with my
   mentor about my whole process.</p>
  <p>
   The day before I'd been running in circles trying to get my code to compile properly since there was
   so much involved with the project.clj file as well as other files that even make the whole system even
   run properly. In my spike story I'd gotten one of my TicTacToe files to run properly in ClojureScript. This
   process took me about half a day to get working, so I deemed that acceptable for my spike story. I figured the
   rest would be straight-forward, but I was wrong in assuming that. Additionally, I had not anticipated how
   difficult getting Speclj to work with ClojureScript was going to be, it took a lot of extra effort beyond just
   putting the dependency in my project.clj file, something I also incorrectly assumed.</p>
  <p>
   After various tuples with Gina she showed me that I needed to pivot directions and use .cljc files which
   is something I hadn't even considered yet. I needed to get my web server to interact with clojure files through
   .cljc files as an interface. By doing this I'm allowed to keep in the code of mine that otherwise is
   incompatible with a web-server, such as the saving and printing. Nonetheless, she showed that I would
   need to refactor a lot of code from my original TicTacToe. I had anticipated that refactoring, and
   getting the server to run without issues, and actually making my implementation would all take well
   over the half-day I had left to get this assignment done, therefore I chose to just be open about
   my progress and put my focus more towards my presentations for my IPM tomorrow.

   Going into today I had one thing to focus on and that was my stateless ttt webpage. I found that progress
   could have gone faster, but I think I hit an okay stopping point for the day.</p>
  <p>
   In particular, I had to do a lot of making shifting my code over to compilable javascript.
   The process of this was a little difficult due to the fact that a lot of tools for getting that to
   work along with speclj were pretty outdated and hard to get information on. However, by about midday
   I had things working as I'd hoped which is good!</p>
  <p>
   There was a serious constraint however, I could not get all the tools for deploying and using TDD
   working on an updated version of closure, it's forcing me to use a pretty outdated version. Tomorrow
   I'm going to ask for help on resolving this issue since I couldn't seem to find a solid solution.</p>
  <p>
   Within my limitation I decided to focus more on the implementation which involved created the new
   ui output for my TTT game. I had to do a bit of research on how to use JavaScript again. I'm happy
   with what I figured out I had enough time in the rest of my day to implement a few methods!

   To start off today, I had a plan of finishing my abstract factory presentation. If I can do that, I'm
   in a good spot to get my ClojureScript project done tomorrow, and finish my last presentation on Wednesday
   in time for IPM.</p>
  <p>
   I am noticing I'm a bit behind due to the push on my last IPM, I still have 10 points of work this week
   but effectively 8 points of time because I lost a whole day. I will remember if this happens in the future
   so that I can bring it to my mentor's attention ahead of time.</p>
  <p>
   Throughout the day, I put my slides together with the research I compiled. I used lots of graphics to
   get across my point and I like the flow of my dialogue. I ended the day by running through it quite a few times
   till I could get through the presentation without following my script. I'll continue to practice
   as the week progresses. Here's an example of a graphic I used!

   I kicked off today with my IPM early in the morning. There wasn't any coding projects so the acceptance
   criteria was much easier to hit than usual. I got everything accepted with no problems, which felt great.
   Micah also suggested I share the Clojure Con 2024 research with Tadd.</p>
  <p>
   After Lunch and Learn I decided to jump into one of my stories which was a presentation on Abstract
   Factories. I did some preliminary research and re-watched the Clean Code video to get a solid understanding
   of the subject. I wrote down some solid notes for Monday and that's how I ended my day. I'm still game
   planning how I want to approach this topic since I don't want to rehash too much information from my last
   presentation.

   This morning I was notified that my IPM would be pushed to tomorrow. I didn't have much to do, and both
   Gina and Micah were pretty busy today, therefore I decided to just run through all my projects today
   and make the quality of my work even better. I re-watched some design pattern videos that I still
   could use a little more understanding on, and otherwise I ran fixed up my presentation with Merl bit by
   bit.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day, Merl and I practiced our dialogue together for when we present at tomorrow's
   Lunch and Learn. We decided to do a little playful conversation for our presentation which I think really
   helps with the entertainment factor. We are both super confident with the quality of our presentation
   for tomorrow.</p>

   I have to finish off my iteration today. To do so I completed three things. The first was
   my spike research on ClojureScript. I looked at some videos on the topic and found the transfer over
   to ClojureScript from my original Clojure TTT code was not super complicated. I did however have to
   factor in the extension of behavior so that my code would display as a web-ui, that along with considering
   any complication made me put my Clojure Script story at 4 points for next week.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of my day, I started by finishing off my Clojure Con research. I had everyone's
   responses for my Google form and was able to do some rough calculations on flight costs and
   chart everyone's availability for the event.</p>
  <p>
   Finishing off my day, I ran through my presentation just a few more times to get ready for my IPM
   Tomorrow!</p>
