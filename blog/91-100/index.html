   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   This post, marks my 100th work day at Clean Coders so that's cause for celebration!
   Given the milestone I'd like to reflect on my time at this company. I still hold the opinion
   that I've vastly improved in my craft since starting here.</p>
  <p>
   When I first started at this company I was piled on loads of new concepts that were intimidating at
   first, but now hold places as core practices for me as a developer and system designer. I was introduced
   to the main practices at Clean Coders, Test Driven Development, and the SOLID principles. It took
   some time for me to marinate on and practice both concepts but I feel more confident than ever in my ability
   to follow them and provide flexible and powerful code that can be used in a collaborative environment.</p>
  <p>
   After some months I got introduced with major challenges, I set foot in new territory working on
   an HTTP server, and a ClojureScript version of my TicTacToe. Though they could be challenges at times, I
   was always able to conquer them and move onto the next step!</p>
  <p>
   More recently, I began working on internal development at the company which, though challenging,
   has been very rewarding for me to provide valuable efforts to the company and learn what it means
   to collaborate in a much better sense.</p>
  <p>
   At the end of the day, I'm proud of myself to keep chugging through this apprenticeship despite
   how challenging it can be. My efforts remind me of the Samurai analogy that Micah gave me when
   I first interviewed with him. I will continue to hone my skills always, that's what a true craftsman
   does.

   Today I focused heavily on the Speclj bug. I wanted to see if I could make some good progress and
   even get this story done. I didn't make the progress I'd hoped for on this story and was still pretty
   stuck by the end of the day. A few times throughout the day I ended up pairing with Alex J. for some
   extra help on this assignment. He ended up giving some good points and was a good pairing partner
   to just help me think out this problem thoroughly and get some progress done.</p>

   Monday I'm coming back from a week at my parent's house so now I can work back in my usual environment.
   I feel refreshed, relaxed, and ready to go! Starting today I worked with Merl a bit on the tooltips story
   from last Friday.</p>
  <p>
   Merl and I spent a good bit of time on this story due to just having issues with the CSS. We ended up having
   to get Olive involved to get a redesign of how these tooltips worked because they weren't consistent in
   every context of them showing up on the webpage. By the end of the day Olive had given a good design that
   I followed and got working fully to be pushed to staging.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the second half of my day, particularly while Olive was doing her redesign, to focus on this
   Speclj bug. This story wasn't finished last week, so I'm hoping to use the time I have now to come up
   with a good solution. After half a day of playing with it and attempting to learn the code I found something
   out. The describe macros are what's in charge of getting the descriptions to
   print out. When the files are reloaded, the describes are submitted and stored in an atom to be printed
   thereafter, along with all of their tests.

   I spent the morning preparing myself for IPM which I was admittedly anxious for given my issues with Speclj, it
   prevented me from getting all my work done.</p>
  <p>
   Fortunately the meeting wasn't so bad, I just showed what I had and that was that. I will take this as a lesson
   to very clearly read everything involved in the acceptance criteria so that I don't make this mistake in the
   future.</p>
  <p>
   After L&L and IPM, I spent the rest of the day working on a new story with Merl. This one involves
   having tooltips for users be visible in the todo section. We diagnosed the issue but ended up having to stop
   to do some infrastructure work.</p>
  <p>
   I ended up pushing some stuff to production but had some issues due to some unknown reason. We got Jake on
   just to make sure everything was working properly and I'll spend some time next week to get this issue resolved.

   Today I talked to Micah about helping me update the Fresh library so I could get the Speclj bug, but I ended up
   finding out that I was not taking the right approach to follow the acceptance criteria. This was very unfortunate
   since that put me back to square one with only a day left to complete this story.</p>
  <p>
   At midday, I participated in a discovery meeting with some craftsmen. Normally these meetings are not for apprentices
   but, I was the one who introduced the potential client, Susan. I did volunteer work for her before I started this
   job to keep my skills sharp as a developer while I was looking for a job. This meeting ended up being a huge
   learning opportunity for me to shadow how craftsmen communicate with clients and talk about pricing and potential
   ideas for them. After the meeting I paired with all the craftsmen, and we estimated everything involved in Susan's
   needs to get a rough idea of what kind of pricing she is looking at.</p>
  <p>
   Back to my Speclj problem, I was supposed to integrate a whole new library as Fresh is deprecated. I spent the rest
   of the day on this but didn't even come close to a solution. I tried pairing with Alex but there just wasn't enough
   time, so I ended up giving the heads-up to my stakeholders before IPM tomorrow.

  <p>
   Starting today, I picked up a new story around a speclj bug where it doesn't see file changes for src files
   in a directory that contains a space character.</p>
  <p>
   I found out what the bug is, the url for files gets encoded when passed
   through the java File object. The problem is the library Fresh is not decoding that url before looking for the file
   path in the src directory. This is leading to it not finding the file at all, therefore it does not
   update anything on the speclj vigilant runner output.</p>
  <p>
   After I zoned it down to the library, I pulled from GitHub and started looking through. Evidently
   I found the bug location after not a whole lot of time and managed to come up with a decent fix that
   made the bug work okay. I wanted to confirm that my changes were working as intended, so I spent some time creating a local jar from Fresh
   that I put into my local version of speclj which I packaged into another local jar to use on an example project to
   confirm my suspicions. After some fiddling everything worked great! Tomorrow I'll get this library updated and
   update Speclj, so I can mark this story as complete!</p>

   Seeing as I finished a story yesterday, I picked up a new one today. The structure of how I work is a little
   different than how I would plan my work in the past. Before I had to commit to 10 points on the first day of the
   week. Now, I still have 10 point velocity, but I pick up a story one at a time instead of all at once. It gives
   me more room to choose what I am more interested in working on which I can appreciate.</p>
  <p>
   Today's story was about having the iteration filter display properly. Fortunately this story really wasn't that
   complicated. I found out quickly where the bug was located and found that the name overrides the iteration number
   if it is set. That can be confusing if the name is contradictory to the iteration number so to fix this I just
   formatted each iteration to be (Iteration #): (Title) (Date). here is the end product.</p>

   I had a fairly long weekend due to traveling and meeting family. I'm spending this week at my parents house to
   celebrate my younger brother's graduation. To work I am using a laptop which I spent Sunday getting properly
   ready for me to develop on without wasting time today.</p>
  <p>
   By the end of the day I had this spinner finally working properly, I'm proud of this one since I managed
   to get it finished myself showing I can do these stories autonomously. It's also noticeable how much easier
   I can navigate through Epic's architecture without spending lots of time trying to comprehend what everything
   is doing.</p>

   I started off this morning by getting everything pushed to staging with Gina's help. She showed me how to use
   infrastructure a little bit so once I have access I'll be able to do this stuff myself. I had about an hour to
   prepare for L&L which I spent making sure I know exactly what I'm presenting and having a before and after to show
   that the problems I addressed were fixed.</p>
  <p>
   Going into L&L I got to see a few presentations from the newer apprentices and also play a dwarf mining game
   courtesy of Alex Root-Roach putting it together as the facilitator. Afterward, I moved onto IPM which ended up
   lasting quite a while, I enjoyed presenting what I had and going through a bunch of stories to estimate them
   with Greg and Merl for the following week.</p>
  <p>
   After a short lunch break I had some time to get started on a story involved with adding a loading spinner to
   acceptance criteria. I managed to isolate the issue before I called it a day.</p>

   Going into today I had to focus on fixing the point story inaccuracy story. This is a bug where Epic calculates
   full points for a user of any given story even if they only contributed half of it for example. My goal today
   is to fix this issue and have it properly calculate half credit if the user only did half the story.</p>
  <p>
   I started the day by pairing with Merl, we got to work trying to understand where the bug lies and how we can
   fix it. After not too long we isolated where the issue lies however solving it was another issue.
   We ended up pairing with Greg for a little additional advice and by the end of the day this story was completed!
   All we need now is to push to staging before IPM tomorrow.
