   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today wasn't too bad, but I spent a lot of time on something I wished I hadn't. I focused on
   two things today, my presentation for Lunch and Learn (L&L), and being able to implement jar files into a
   clojure project.</p>
  <p>
   First, I did some last practice on my presentation before L&L. I feel good about how the presentation went,
   and I could tell I hit all the points I missed a few weeks ago. The rest of L&L was also enjoyable. I
   always like observing the work that the craftsmen do, it lets me look ahead and also explore interesting
   concepts.</p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the day, I worked on getting my jar files to be implemented into my clojure project. This
   was much more difficult than I'd anticipated. The Tic Tac Toe file wasn't too bad, but it did take over
   an hour, where I expected it to take 10 minutes. The HTTP_Server however took much longer. Getting Java
   files to work with Clojure files is pretty tricky. First I needed to build a jar file, then I had to
   place it into my project and make it findable. After lots of research I found there was some
   interaction I had to do with the maven repository for this to work. This made me have to do an additional
   step that was hard to find the answer for. After lots of trial and error however, I managed to make the
   libraries work within my project.

   I was pretty happy with how my IPM turned out. Micah had stacked meetings, so he never ended up coming.
   Because of this, I didn't show my presentation, I'm going to do that during Lunch and Learn tomorrow.
   I was really confident in how my tests were structured, they were super involved and covered every line
   of code to my knowledge.</p>
  <p>
   Afterward, I was given a new task to combine my tic-tac-toe and HTTP_Server libraries together
   into a new project to make a web-based ttt game. It doesn't seem too tricky given that I've already
   implemented the two libraries, I just need to put them together.</p>
  <p>
   I also had two Clean Code videos to watch today, so that's how I ended my afternoon. The videos were
   on advanced test driven development. I felt with the momentum I had, I wanted to jump right into more
   TDD concepts!</p>

   Going into today, my main goal was to get my final few tests to pass in the spec file I was given,
   particularly focusing on getting the file uploading to work properly.</p>
  <p>
   Your explanation is clear, but it could be refined a bit for smoother flow. Here's a slightly polished version:

   "I ended up getting stuck longer than anticipated on a specific aspect of the file upload process,
   which involved properly reading in the file data. When the data was sent through a POST request,
   numerous headers were appended to it, requiring me to parse them out. Additionally, I encountered
   an issue where the file size kept changing unpredictably after the upload, which perplexed me. After
   experimenting with various solutions, I discovered that there were footers embedded within the file.
   Once I removed these footers, the file upload functioned perfectly."</p>
  <p>
   With some time left in my day, I dedicated it to last-minute practice for my presentation and
   ensuring I'm fully prepared for my IPM tomorrow.

   Today, I'd hoped to finally finish off my testing by no later than noon and hit the ground running on my
   other testing story. To my pleasant surprise, not only did I get my first testing story completed by noon,
   but I was also right about the second testing story being much easier thanks to how thorough I was in the
   first story!</p>
  <p>
   By the time I completed my first testing environment, I was incredibly happy with how good my project
   looks and feels. This is the most thorough I've been on a project so far. I'd like to take these lessons
   going forward to re-evaluate how much time I give myself on each project and how much effort I put into
   testing. I have a good feeling that this is the key for me to reach Clean Coders' standards as a software
   craftsman.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of my day, I worked on the second test story. This story involved injecting Clojure
   tests that Micah had made some time ago into my server command line to get expected output. I had five
   test files and breezed through the first three in just half a day! I ran into a little reworking where
   the tests expected features or specific ways to output that I had not done with my original code just
   because I couldn't have known until now. Those reworks took some time, but it wasn't anything serious.
   After I had gotten three files testing properly, I decided to call it a day. I should have plenty of time
   to get the last two test files working tomorrow and have room to spare so that I can do some last edits
   and practice on my presentation before my IPM on Thursday.

   With the new workweek starting, I feel refreshed and ready to get this testing finished off.
   Regardless of my progress, I plan to work on my presentation story by the end of the day so that
   I have some legroom to practice it properly before Thursday.</p>
  <p>
   I spent most of my day getting this story finished, but wasn't quite able to finish it off. However,
   I'm very close! Tomorrow will likely be a long day since I need to finish this story off and get into
   my other testing story. Fortunately, I have a feeling that having done my current story so thoroughly
   will make the next one notably easier, as they are very similar stories. By the end of my time working on
   these tests, I had finished everything except a few implementations on my <b>ClientResponse,</b> one of my
   low-level implementations that has a lot of possible outputs. It needs a lot of tests to go with it.</p>
  <p>
   For the latter portion of my day, I got some work done on the presentation I have on Component Design.
   I started this story a few weeks ago but fell short on some material, so I'm doing this as a makeup.
   I'm hoping that this will help offset the extra time I spent on my testing story because I have most
   of this presentation done already. I re-watched the Uncle Bob video on the principles of Component Design
   that I missed and made some slides for them in my presentation. I feel that the length of it is too long now.
   Tomorrow I'll find a way to compress my content a bit.</p>

   Today, I had one goal and one goal only in mind: to finish up the tests for my HTTP Server.
   However, things did not go as I'd hoped.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the first half of the day restructuring my entire project to have a more higher-level
   to low-level hierarchy. This involved making interfaces, object factories, mock objects,
   and mock object factories. Needless to say, it was a lot of new code and time spent just
   getting things to be more polymorphic so that I could properly test for side effects. It
   makes the comment Micah made all the more understandable. If I had more closely followed TDD,
   I would have been forced to design this structure from the start. But what happened, happened.
   It's better that I learn from this more than anything!</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day, I ran into an issue with getting the server to properly read
   input and output streams. Eventually, I got it working consistently. What's cool is that now
   I can make a server with either mock objects or real objects for parsing and returning information.
   The more high-level I want the testing to be, the more mock objects I use, and the more low-level,
   the more real objects I use! Though I'm behind, I'm really learning a lot from this experience.</p>

   I felt good coming out of IPM today. Having such a huge 10-point assignment be accepted all at once is
   somewhat satisfying. However, they gave me work to do for this week on my HTTP Server. The biggest point
   out was that I didn't test my server nearly enough. I had anticipated this going into the meeting because
   of the time constraints that prevented me from fully testing my project. I also had issues coming up with
   solutions for how to test side effects rather than exact return values. Micah pointed out something that
   really made sense with how I should go forward. By strictly following TDD, I'm also forcing myself to follow
   the SOLID principles. It was not something I'd considered in the past, but it makes sense. A lot of my would-be
   tests were impossible due to not following the basic rules of SOLID like dependency inversion.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the second half of my day jumping into restructuring my project to have fully involved tests.
   After a few hours, I realized I had definitely underestimated how long this would take. I've only finished
   off one file, and that took me hours. Mostly, there was lots of time working out how I would test for side
   effects. I'm hoping once I get over that learning curve, the rest of the test setup will go faster.</p>
