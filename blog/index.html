   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today, I had one goal and one goal only in mind: to finish up the tests for my HTTP Server.
   However, things did not go as I'd hoped.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the first half of the day restructuring my entire project to have a more higher-level
   to low-level hierarchy. This involved making interfaces, object factories, mock objects,
   and mock object factories. Needless to say, it was a lot of new code and time spent just
   getting things to be more polymorphic so that I could properly test for side effects. It
   makes the comment Micah made all the more understandable. If I had more closely followed TDD,
   I would have been forced to design this structure from the start. But what happened, happened.
   It's better that I learn from this more than anything!</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day, I ran into an issue with getting the server to properly read
   input and output streams. Eventually, I got it working consistently. What's cool is that now
   I can make a server with either mock objects or real objects for parsing and returning information.
   The more high-level I want the testing to be, the more mock objects I use, and the more low-level,
   the more real objects I use! Though I'm behind, I'm really learning a lot from this experience.</p>

   I felt good coming out of IPM today. Having such a huge 10-point assignment be accepted all at once is
   somewhat satisfying. However, they gave me work to do for this week on my HTTP Server. The biggest point
   out was that I didn't test my server nearly enough. I had anticipated this going into the meeting because
   of the time constraints that prevented me from fully testing my project. I also had issues coming up with
   solutions for how to test side effects rather than exact return values. Micah pointed out something that
   really made sense with how I should go forward. By strictly following TDD, I'm also forcing myself to follow
   the SOLID principles. It was not something I'd considered in the past, but it makes sense. A lot of my would-be
   tests were impossible due to not following the basic rules of SOLID like dependency inversion.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the second half of my day jumping into restructuring my project to have fully involved tests.
   After a few hours, I realized I had definitely underestimated how long this would take. I've only finished
   off one file, and that took me hours. Mostly, there was lots of time working out how I would test for side
   effects. I'm hoping once I get over that learning curve, the rest of the test setup will go faster.</p>
