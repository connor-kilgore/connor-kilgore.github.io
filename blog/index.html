   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today I got to go to Micah's house to have an in person work experience! But before I get ahead of myself,
   I started this morning by pushing my changes to production and syncing Micah's accounts. Incidentally,
   I forgot to do the sync on Poker's end, so I ended up spending a lot more time today getting that fixed up too.
   However, by the end of the day I had it finished and Micah's accounts were synced successfully.</p>
  <p>
   As for what I did today, I got to meet up with some other Clean Coders for the first time ever today.
   It was a great experience to break some ice with some people and get to know Micah better as well.
   We had lunch together, played some basketball, and went out to dinner together. I also got to meet Micah's
   wife, she was a very interesting person, she has lots of stories about 8th Light that are fun to listen
   to.</p>
  <p>
   I also go a confirmation from Micah that I start my challenge tomorrow! I'm very excited for the opportunity to
   move to the next step and move forward in my career.

   Like I mentioned yesterday, I started this morning by pairing with Brandon. He naturally had a lot of things to
   say about the code I had which led to a ton of refactors that had me working on this for the rest of the day.
   First issue I found was that members need to be deleted if they overlap with existing members of the super-user.
   We also found that my tests could have more coverage over specific edge cases I didn't think about.</p>
  <p>
   After a few hours, we did a deploy and tested it with Brandon's account but as we did it I realized we had
   forgot about another edge case that needed to be reworked. This edge case was a tough fix but necessary.
   By the end of the day it was working as intended, in the morning I plan to deploy to prod and get Micah's
   accounts synced up.

   Starting today, I'm jumped into the story to consolidate Micah's users. I got a little started with Gina in
   the morning during our weekly pairing. She got me started with a spec file that can ensure that my script
   will migrate as needed. We worked on it for about an hour then I moved onto my own work later on.</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the day I spent getting this to a usable spot and I feel as though I nearly got there.
   In the morning I'm going to reach out to brandon for some quality assurance and then get this deployed to
   production.

   I started this week completely fresh to go take another stab at the story Merl and I were working
   on last week. However, first Merl, Greg, and I got together to look at a new high priority story that
   Micah brought up Friday evening. We did a little bit of work on it but needed to ask Micah a few questions which
   he took a while to get back to us on, so we stopped our progress on it for the day.</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the day Merl and I spent on the save configs story which we fell short on. I'm glad we took a whole
   extra day to work on it instead of giving a much weaker demo the previous week. We fixed up all the technical debt
   we had accrued and also added in the deletion feature. By the end of the day, we had an incredibly solid
   implementation that we both felt really good about to bring to IPM this coming Friday.</p>

   Today was IPM, and as I had guessed, Merl and I just couldn't get our story to a production-ready state, so
   we opted not to demo it today. Greg also wasn't able to wrap up the Jira Import story from yesterday either, so
   we definitely had a bad week in terms of what we accomplished.</p>
  <p>
   For L&L we played a Chess tournament which I actually enjoyed a lot. It re-reminded me how much I used to enjoy
   playing this game with my Brothers back when we were kids. I'll probably start playing again on my own time.
   As for IPM, Micah seemed fairly understanding of what happened and just told us that we should come up with
   strategies to avoid situations like this in the future. Once we finished IPM the apprentices and I stayed
   on to reflect and brainstorm ways we could approach our stories and estimations in the future. One idea that I liked
   was focusing on priorities. I spent too much time on a two-points low-priority story. I should have moved on sooner
   than later. Focusing too heavily on a single story can lose more points than its worth which is just not worth it.</p>
  <p>
   After that, we then just pushed a few things to staging and production and there I called it a day since I have
   a flight I have to get ready for tonight.</p>

   I had a lot of work to do today. I ended up splitting stories with both Greg and Merl to work on
   in the morning and afternoon respectively. Incidentally, we are all working behind schedule this week.
   I paired with Greg in the morning on a Jira import story which we made good progress on but didn't quite finish.
   He ended up staying to work on it while I moved over to the story I had with Merl.</p>
  <p>
   Merl and I ended up working on a story to have saved filter configs on the weekly page. We worked up until almost
   midnight but just couldn't quite finish everything, we are hoping to wrap things up in the morning.
   I don't have a whole-lot of optimism around that however because there is just a lot to fix up on the tests,
   the main functionality, and we still need to add in a delete feature. Regardless, I did try my best so I'm
   just happy to be done with the work I did today.</p>
