   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Starting today, I picked up a new story around a speclj bug where it doesn't see file changes for src files
   in a directory that contains a space character. I spent all of today trying to diagnose this bug and found the issue
   lies within the Fresh library I ran out of time, but I know where to start for the next day.</p>
  <p>
   I also found out what the bug is, just not where it lies. I found that the url for files gets encoded when passed
   through the java File object. The problem is the library Fresh is not decoding that url before looking for the file
   path in the src directory. This is leading to it not finding the file at all, therefore it does not
   update anything on the speclj vigilant runner output.</p>

   Seeing as I finished a story yesterday, I picked up a new one today. The structure of how I work is a little
   different than how I would plan my work in the past. Before I had to commit to 10 points on the first day of the
   week. Now, I still have 10 point velocity, but I pick up a story one at a time instead of all at once. It gives
   me more room to choose what I am more interested in working on which I can appreciate.</p>
  <p>
   Today's story was about having the iteration filter display properly. Fortunately this story really wasn't that
   complicated. I found out quickly where the bug was located and found that the name overrides the iteration number
   if it is set. That can be confusing if the name is contradictory to the iteration number so to fix this I just
   formatted each iteration to be (Iteration #): (Title) (Date). here is the end product.</p>

   I had a fairly long weekend due to traveling and meeting family. I'm spending this week at my parents house to
   celebrate my younger brother's graduation. To work I am using a laptop which I spent Sunday getting properly
   ready for me to develop on without wasting time today.</p>
  <p>
   By the end of the day I had this spinner finally working properly, I'm proud of this one since I managed
   to get it finished myself showing I can do these stories autonomously. It's also noticeable how much easier
   I can navigate through Epic's architecture without spending lots of time trying to comprehend what everything
   is doing.</p>

   I started off this morning by getting everything pushed to staging with Gina's help. She showed me how to use
   infrastructure a little bit so once I have access I'll be able to do this stuff myself. I had about an hour to
   prepare for L&L which I spent making sure I know exactly what I'm presenting and having a before and after to show
   that the problems I addressed were fixed.</p>
  <p>
   Going into L&L I got to see a few presentations from the newer apprentices and also play a dwarf mining game
   courtesy of Alex Root-Roach putting it together as the facilitator. Afterward, I moved onto IPM which ended up
   lasting quite a while, I enjoyed presenting what I had and going through a bunch of stories to estimate them
   with Greg and Merl for the following week.</p>
  <p>
   After a short lunch break I had some time to get started on a story involved with adding a loading spinner to
   acceptance criteria. I managed to isolate the issue before I called it a day.</p>

   Going into today I had to focus on fixing the point story inaccuracy story. This is a bug where Epic calculates
   full points for a user of any given story even if they only contributed half of it for example. My goal today
   is to fix this issue and have it properly calculate half credit if the user only did half the story.</p>
  <p>
   I started the day by pairing with Merl, we got to work trying to understand where the bug lies and how we can
   fix it. After not too long we isolated where the issue lies however solving it was another issue.
   We ended up pairing with Greg for a little additional advice and by the end of the day this story was completed!
   All we need now is to push to staging before IPM tomorrow.
