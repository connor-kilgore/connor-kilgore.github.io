   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Going into this week I feel fully reset from last week! I want to get my HTTP Server done the end of
   tomorrow, so that I still have a day to focus on my TicTacToe clean up.</p>
  <p>
   Today ended up being a pretty big trudge mostly because I was working out some refactoring to get my
   server to work properly in the context of a library. This involved adjusting a few more functions
   and setting up my ttt-web application to use it properly. Near midday, I got pretty stuck on the
   reoccurring problem I'm having which is that my point of entry in this application is at the HTTP_Server
   library, but I need to send that data back to my ttt-web application. I decided to pocket it for now
   and put some time into catching up on some clean code videos I have to watch. That took up the rest of my
   day.</p>

   Today was all about jumping into making my HTTP server more extensible, and usable from high-level
   function calls. I am happy with my productivity today because I got a few things here and there done
   instead of focusing on one thing like I usually tend to do.</p>
  <p>
   For the first half of the day I watched another Uncle Bob video, I have quite a few to watch this week
   so instead of having a day dedicated to cramming all this knowledge with 8 hours of video watching, I'm
   going to try to watch one video in the morning of each day, and some days at the end of my day as well.</p>
  <p>
   After my videos, I went to Lunch and Learn. I could only stay the first 45 minutes because I had an
   appointment to go to, fortunately the actual IPM portion of it was over before then, so I only missed out
   on the game section a bit.</p>
  <p>
   After getting back from my appointment, I ended up diving into my HTTP server implementation for the rest of
   the day. Where I went wrong last week was that I had used low-level functions for my server library, when instead
   I should have focused on high level function calls. The current state of my library is unable to handle that
   simply because it is not fully OCP compliant.</p>
  <p>
   I ended up spending a few hours migrating my ttt-web project from a Leiningen to a debs.edn project.
   Getting this to work properly and import the jar files was tricky, but I got it working.</p>
  <p>
   Afterward, I was able to finish up my day by cleaning up some of the function calls in my HTTP_Server.
   This included changing some names and designing a few functions that have the intention of being used
   in the context as an API.</p>

   I went into IPM today knowing that I had not the best work to show, but that's okay. I feel as though
   I more than made up for it with the lessons I took back today. I've struggled with underestimating
   my projects in the past, but I'm ready to pivot how I estimate to be more fair to myself. It's something
   that will be crucial to my success as a craftsmen, I can't promise clients unrealistic timelines.</p>
  <p>
   During my meeting I ended up asking Gina for some advice on how I might better estimate with caution.
   She gave two good pointers that I won't forget.</p>
  <p>
   The first was to ask for spike stories. A spike story is one, maybe two points dedicating to doing some
   research on the actual story so that I can give it a fair estimate. This typically only applies when
   I'm assigned a task that contains new topics for me. This would have heavily applied in my ttt-web
   project because I would have been able to better anticipate the mountain of refactoring I'd have to do
   for this project to work properly.</p>
  <p>
   The second piece of advice was to spend extra time on breaking down my projects to further understand
   exactly what I'm committing to. What that means is that when I'm asked to estimate one story, I'll break
   it up into smaller stories pinpointing the major things I have to accomplish to get the entire story done.
   That allows me to individually estimate each step, instead of the story as a whole. I ended up doing this
   for next weeks' work which I found monumentally helpful.</p>
  <p>
   After leaving IPM today I felt refreshed and ready to tackle my new tasks, more confident in the time I
   allotted for them. I ended my day off by watching a few videos on Advanced Test Driven Development.</p>
