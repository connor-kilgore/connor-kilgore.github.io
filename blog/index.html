   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today was a good day! I had my IPM meeting and this time I was able to be fully prepared for it.
   I brought in all my work from the iteration and did really well! It seemed as though Gina and Micah were both
   satisfied with the work I did.</p>
  <p>
   First I presented my Euler problems, they noticed the improvement in the layout,
   tests and quality of the work from last week. I was given suggestions on using threads and tail recursion, both
   things I ended up doing in Euler 12 later today!</p>
  <p> Next I did my Kata which I did really well on, the code just flowed out of my fingertips and gave for a great
  demonstration of mastery at my IPM. The feedback they gave was pretty extensive on this one and I was sure to write
  everything down. It mostly bogged down to making it cleaner and to not pre-factor my steps.</p>
  <p> Last was my SRP presentation. The biggest comment was that I overcomplicated the topic too much. I went too
  into detail on the decoupling strategies and communicated information that was unnecessarily technical. They also
  recommended I add a personal touch to my presentation to be more entertaining for the viewers. Both are things I'll
  be sure to take into my next presentation on Closed Responsibility Principle. We finished off the meeting by
  planning my next iteration.</p>
  <p> Given that I still had another half-day, I jumped right into my next iteration. First I watched an Uncle Bob video
  on Use Cases, which I found to be quite informative. It left me a good idea on how to approach designing software
  architecturally. I finished my day by doing Euler problem 12 which I managed to add in both thread-first and
  tail-recursion to optimize and clean my code.</p>
