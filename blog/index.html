   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today was the wrap-up of my main implementation onto of my stateless ClojureScript TTT game. I got almost entirely
   finished but there was still some wrap-ups I had left to do, I'm going to save those for Tuesday before my
   IPM.</p>
  <p>
   In the morning I got started on things, in particular I designed the grids for my TicTacToe game in the web-ui
   format, I'm quite pleased with how it looks and the user-input is fairly intuitive.</p>
  <p>
   Next on my agenda was Lunch and Learn, I was in charge of facilitating the game, therefore I spent some time
   ensuring I had a game that would be fun for everybody. Initially I was going to repeat a game played earlier on
   but I decided to go with a JackBox game that I happen to own.</p>
  <p>
   After Lunch and Learn I spent the rest of the day on my ClojureScript project. It mostly works but there's still
   some things I'd like to fix up, as I mentioned I'm going to fix them up on Tuesday after memorial-day weekend.

   My focus today was understanding Reagent much more deeply since I rushed myself to get this project
   done before my IPM. I clearly didn't understand it well enough to be confident using it.</p>
  <p>
   For the morning I took time looking at Reagent materials and tutorials to ensure I know how it works. My biggest
   issue was I misunderstood the use of the render function and ratoms. Micah talked about this a little bit yesterday.
   I assumed rendering had to be recalled each update, but it acts more as an event driven listener that waits for
   updates in a specified ratom to update itself. It took some fiddling, but eventually I got my project restructured
   to use rendering and ratoms properly.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day I got my menu put in for my TicTacToe game, and I worked on the board a little bit.
   I am very close to being done I just need a few more implementations and tests for this project to finally be done
   with the coding part. Afterward I need to put it on my blog to be a fully usable stateless TTT game.

   My IPM went as expected. I had to explain my situation to my mentor and go back and get this project finished
   for good. Micah gave me some good tips on project flow and how I can properly use Reagent since I was doing
   some things wrong.</p>
  <p>
   During the meeting my project encountered some build issues that needed to be resolved so that's what I
   focused on for the rest of the day. It took some playing around, but eventually I got things working okay.
   I seem to be dealing with an issue where the project sometimes compiles wrong and doesn't see certain files
   when it should. I found a workaround by using the dev build and the script in my dev project to get it to
   properly see my TicTacToe files and everything seems to work just fine!
