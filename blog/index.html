					Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
					for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
					after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
					what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

					Today was my second day at the company and also a Friday which means I got to participate in the some interesting
					meetings with the company. We had our morning check in as usual, I had something to say this time, talking about
					the work I did yesterday. However things got really interesting during our Lunch and Learn meeting.</p>
				<p> 
					This was certainly a long meeting, lasting just over two hours. During this meeting I got my first real insight into the
					day-to-day of craftsmen and what kind of projects they worked on. First I got to listen to a presentation
					from Gina and how others reacted to it, giving her constructive criticism.
					Next, we went over peoples show-and-tell for the week on what they did and what input other people had.
					The process was reminiscent of my capstone, being able to
					share progress, make suggestions, and come up with new tasks for the following week. Needless to say, I learned a lot by
					listening in, I look forward to the next one. At the end of it, we played <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> as a
					fun team building exercise which I won.</p>
				<p> 
					I didn't finish my Clojure Koans by the time I said I would. As a result, at the start of the day I spoke with Gina and she told me
					to be communicative about if I'm behind on work or not. It left me to reflect on perhaps why I was told to use the poker
					program in the first place to estimate how long this project would take me. Truthfully I had no idea at the time, all I could really
					do was guess, it was my first day and I wasn't given the chance to look at the project more in-depth to get a better estimate. I came to the conclusion
					that perhaps this is some kind of initiation lesson that Clean Coders does. It really emphasizes being transparent with clients and
					colleagues. If I succeed in this apprencticeship, I will likely have to deal with this exact issue, in real scenarios, on much bigger projects, and with
					time and money at stake. All in all, I'm glad to have this hammered in now and not later.</p>
				<p>
					As for my actual project, I could notice the improvement of my grasp on this language today. It took me less time to
					understand new concepts. More often than not I was able to figure out answers from my own deductions without
					extra research or reference. I certainly spent the most time on destructuring. It was a fascinating topic and left me with a
					lot of room to find my own approach for answers. I particularly enjoyed one about putting together a string of all of
					Rich Hickey's nicknames. I could have done an easier more verbose solution, but I wanted to find a way to make my answer more
					sophisticated. the rest of the koans were also interesting but I did not take too long on any
					of them.

					Today was my first day at <b>Clean Coders</b>. Admittedly it was an anxious day as is any first day of a new job.
					Fortunately everyone was warm and welcoming during my onboarding process. I met some of my potential future colleagues
					as well as my mentors and bosses.</p>
				<p>
					I spoke mostly with Micah and Gina regarding first steps. Micah purchased a Mac Mini
					for me to use which is exciting. I've never used another OS for software development, but I hope to never go back to Windows,
					It does not have good command line support after all. Gina helped me with getting my first assignments, one of which is
					setting up this very blog. I was assigned to set up a github.io site however I made one years ago so all I had to do was add in this new page.
					Though I'm no expert UX designer, I know how to make it look decent and functional, which is perfect for this ongoing project. Gina also
					helped me navigate to other applications I'd need for this apprencticeship such as Tuple, IntelliJ, Epic, and Poker.</p>
				<p>
					My first real challenge was the <b>Clojure Koans</b> assignment I was given. It serves as an educational guide for me to become familiar with clojure,
					the primarily used language at Clean Coders. Clojure needless to say is a steep learning curve. It appears to be a less verbose language at the
					expense of it being much harder to read for inexperienced persons. It also uses prefix notation which I'm no stranger to, but will still take some
					getting used to.</p>
				<p>
					In this assignment I had to fill in unit tests and get them to pass by putting in the right code snippets or parameters. I was given 27 clojure
					files each with on average around ten tests in them. I got through 14 at the time of writing this entry and I hope to do a few more before I call it a day.
					Initially it was quite straightforward and easy, I breezed through the first five or six. Then I began hitting tests with answers that needed more
					understanding of the language to apply my prerequisite knowledge of coding. It was a slow trog for a few hours, I spent it really trying
					to learn how to read this code and understand how the interpreter read the language. I basically had an answer key by looking at the koans file but it wouldn't help me
					truly understand, so I used it for reference only.</p>
				<p>
					My aha moment finally arrived on the 14th file, recursion. I know recursion, and I know it well, but that also means I know how tricky it can be,
					especially when learning a new language. I didn't understand fully how loops worked yet and how to pair that with recur in Clojure syntax. It took
					me a good while just researching and examining these tests to understand them, and then it clicked! With that I was able to come up with my own solution
					to <b>recursive-reverse</b> and <b>factorial</b> that differed from the answer key. When I am able to splinter off into my own line of thinking and my own
					approach, instead of hugging the examples and given answers, that is when I know I'm beggining to understand at a fundamental level. At that point I stopped
					with a feeling of satisfaction in my mind, and believing I have done enough today to share in this blog post.</p>
