   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today was heavily focused on the 4x4 implementation of my Tic Tac Toe Board. This story was really involved
   mostly because my existing code wasn't following OCP well enough. I had to refactor old code just to be able
   to extend new implementation, so I spent a lot of time making it compliant with OCP. This mostly involved
   changing how my menu screen allows user selection, as well as being open to any size board and how those inputs
   would be processed. I found this work to be quite rewarding because I can go back on my earlier work and
   understand myself exactly how I could have done it better. This is practice that after a while of continually
   hammering down, I can hopefully follow without even thinking about it!</p>
  <p>
   After my code was looking open for extension, I needed to implement a 4x4 board, the
   meat of this story. Getting it to work for users was fine, just a bit of fiddling with the inputs, but the AI
   implementation was incredibly difficult. Early on I got it working in theory, but the computation time was
   way too long to be acceptable. When doing an involved tree search through 9 levels of permutations, it takes
   a few seconds, but at 16 levels for the 4x4 board, it was more likely hours or even days.</p>
  <p>
   I started researching solutions for this issue and came across two concepts, limited depth search and
   alpha-beta-pruning. Both were pretty hard to implement and get my AI to behave as it should. After half
   a day of attempting, I was not successful in getting this working, but I feel as though I'm close,
   tomorrow I will finish this off.</p>

   Today was the day I really dived into implementing a 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe board, a feat I figured would
   be the hardest of my tasks this week. So far that seems to be true. I spent a good portion of the day
   rewriting my older code because it wasn't OCP friendly. What I mean by this is, a lot of my supporting
   functions were only able to handle a 3x3 board scenario, like my win-checkers, printers, etc. After
   a few hours I fixed those all up to handle any case without issues. Ultimately it forced me to come
   up with much more elegant solutions that utilized lazy sequences over recursion. I found my results
   to be quite satisfying. By fixing these issues, my algorithm for selecting the next best move naturally
   complied with a 4x4 board. In theory it works, but it is far too slow to be acceptable. The 3x3 board
   takes a few seconds to calculate, but the 4x4 takes minutes or even hours to compute. Tomorrow I will
   focus on coming up with a faster computation time.</p>
  <p>
   Afterwords, I focused on my Interface Segregation Principle presentation. I started with the initial research,
   it always helps to go back to the Uncle Bob video for reference, and also get some outside sources to further
   understand the concept. Tomorrow I'll put that information into slides and get my dialogue ready to go.</p>

   Today marks one month since I've joined Clean Coders. As a general reflection, I'd like to point
   out how amazing the mentorship has been here. I can tell my ability to work and communicate as a
   professional improves every day. The quality of my work has also skyrocketed thanks to following
   SOLID principles and TDD. As I continue this mentorship, I will remind myself to always learn
   new things and improve upon myself each day.</p>
  <p>
   As for what I did today, I have a lot of work to do on my Tic Tac Toe project so that's what I
   did all today, aside from the LnL meeting. At the LnL, I got to present on Liskov Substitution again,
   it went well and people seemed impressed with it. Then I got to see other people's internal
   projects for the week which is fascinating as usual.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the rest of my day doing two things to my Tic Tac Toe project. The first was refactoring
   my dependency hierarchy as best I could so that high level modules didn't unnecessarily depend
   on lower level modules. The second thing I did was implement a two player option in the game, to
   allow the user to play with a second user instead of the impossible AI. I managed to
   complete the implementation as I write this blog post, but if I have time, I'd like to come back to
   this before my next IPM to do some final touch ups and revisions.</p>

   I left today feeling really accomplished with the work I presented at IPM. Last week could have gone better
   as I've likely mentioned in earlier posts. There was a lot of repeat mistakes I made that I wanted to fix after last
   week's IPM. I feel as though I took a lot of advice and improved on it.</p>
  <p>
   Going into my IPM, I was a bit nervous given last week's result, but I was extra critical with improving
   my entertainment factor, being the ringleader of the meeting, and ensuring that my work is acceptable in
   the parameters I was given. I ended up leaving the meeting with everything being accepted and not
   having to have repeat advice, but instead new constructive criticism to take into my next week!</p>
  <p>
   For this next iteration, I have a lot of additions to add onto my Tic-Tac-Toe board. In theory, they
   don't seem super difficult, but I can tell they are there to challenge my ability to follow the
   SOLID principles better as I continue to design my project. I'd like to refactor some of my old
   code to better follow the discipline as I work on these new tasks.</p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the day I finished up one of the smaller stories I had, which was just adding in
   error messaging on invalid inputs. Then I had enough time to get started on my multiplayer
   implementation which I intend to work on most tomorrow.</p>
