   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today, I entered my IPM fairly confident about the work I had to deliver. However, I realized that
   I need to do some rework on my Component Design presentation. I missed some principles that are
   involved with the presentation, so when I am given the chance again, I'll go back and conduct more
   in-depth research on the subject for next time!</p>
  <p>
   At the end of the meeting, I was assigned a significant task: setting up an HTTP server in Java from
   scratch. They allotted me the entire week to complete this project. When they say "from scratch,"
   it entails using server sockets and managing client intake to the fullest extent possible. Given my
   experience with server sockets, I'm optimistic about breezing through this project. While my experience
   mainly involves TCP connections, I'm uncertain how much it'll differ with HTTP. However, I am familiar
   with byte reading and multi-threading to handle separate client connections.</p>
  <p>
   I dedicated the afternoon to conducting some refresher research and reacquainting myself with the
   material. By the end of the day, I successfully set up a basic Java EchoServer that simply prints
   out any input received from clients.</p>

   Just like yesterday, I had a lot of work on my database to do today. I have to implement
   the SQL code that clojure executes to get the proper information to pass back to my code.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the majority of my day getting these functions set up, along with their appropriate tests.
   I really liked how involved my tests ended up being; it was a clear example of improvement in my
   TDD that I noticed. It took some fiddling with the database, especially because it can't handle
   multi-value columns. I had to set up some in-between tables to handle the 1-n relationships.</p>
  <p>
   After the database query system was set up, I just had to get them paired up with my multi-methods
   for the save functionality I'm already using with file-saving. The seamless extension of my psqldb
   module into the rest of my system was something I really appreciated. I haven't properly seen the
   benefits of OCP until now, so it was a huge 'aha' moment for me!</p>
  <p>
   I had to work late today, but thankfully I got my database implementation ready to go for tomorrow
   and I'm ready for my presentation on Component Design as well!</p>

   Today was all about my database implementation. I quickly realized that I had a lot more work
   to do on my technical debt. There was still a lot of code that needed proper separation for this
   new implementation to function smoothly.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the first few hours making an argument parser that can take in arguments in any order and
   properly understand them. This way, there are no issues if the user wants to interchange arguments
   in no particular order</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the day was spent working on my database implementation. I had to do some initial
   research on PostgreSQL. I'm pretty rusty on SQL, and implementing PostgreSQL in Clojure is new
   to me, so it took some research. Near the end of the day, I had my code properly connecting to
   a locally created database. I played around with making and showing tables, but I also had to
   practice my presentation a few times to end the day.</p>

   Starting this week, I aimed to seek clarification on the issues I encountered last Thursday
   with multi-methods. I ended up messaging Gina about my questions and received the answers I needed.
   Today, I plan to focus on finishing up my technical debt.</p>
  <p>
   First I started more work on my Component design presentation. I spent the first half of the
   day researching, and putting together my slides and dialogue for the presentation. I now
   have a solid understanding of the subject material, I just need to practice the dialogue
   periodically over the next few days for my IPM on Thursday.</p>
  <p>
   I finished up the day by addressing my technical debt. Needless to say, these technical debts
   are becoming quite costly for 0-point assignments. I find myself a little behind schedule since
   I still need to fully implement the database over the next two days. However, I see these technical
   debts as valuable learning experiences that ultimately contribute to a smoother implementation
   process for new features. In a way, I've been laying the groundwork for the database implementation all along.</p>
  <p>
   Also, I forgot to post my kata video on Friday, so here it is!</p>

   Today, I aimed to tackle all the minor tasks so that I wouldn't have much else to focus on.
   My primary focus was on completing my video for the bowling game kata, followed by watching
   the remaining videos on component design.</p>
  <p>
   I completed the video sooner than anticipated, which allowed me to invest additional time in
   improving and rehearsing my kata. Following the advice given during my IPM yesterday, I first
   restructured my tests to adhere to a proper test structure with <b>Build</b>, <b>Operate</b>,
   and <b>Check</b> attributes. Additionally, I revamped my kata to be more polymorphic and object-oriented.
   After primarily using Clojure in recent months, I found myself slipping out of Java habits, so this
   served as a valuable refresher.</p>
  <p>
   Afterwards, I delved into the video production process. This segment wasn't too challenging;
   I simply had to record, add voice-over, and edit, which only took a few hours to complete. By
   the end, I still had some time left to watch the Component Design Videos.</p>
  <p>
   Needless to say, I am struggling a bit to understand the concepts from Component Design.
   I want to do some more research and understanding on the subject before I complete the tests.</p>

   Today, I had IPM, and I was pleasantly surprised by how my work turned out. Despite setbacks with my
   3x3x3 board, I had anticipated that there might not be a full delivery. However, my hard work paid off,
   and I entered the meeting with all my features working perfectly! By the end of the meeting, I received
   good feedback on my projects, and everything was accepted!</p>
  <p>
   In particular, Gina gave me lots of advice on how to make my project more polymorphic by completely
   separating the TUI and GUI. Going into next week, I'll apply the same advice to how I'll implement
   the database functionality.</p>
  <p>
   I spent the rest of the day working on my technical debt. By the end of the day, I
   had made good progress on separating my user interfaces. However, I ended up getting
   stuck on how to call multi-methods in different namespaces, which I'll tackle tomorrow.</p>
