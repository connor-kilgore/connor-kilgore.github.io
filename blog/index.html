   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   The finalizing touches took a while today, but looking back, I'm proud of the work I've done this week
   and more than ready to show what I've accomplished to my mentors tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   I started today by finishing work on my presentation. I ended up revising a good bit of the information
   and dialogue, which meant I had to practice some new lines and spend time creating new slides. As a result,
   this took me a little over half the day. Fortunately, I was pleased with how my presentation turned out.</p>
  <p>
   Afterward, I spent most of the rest of my day recording, voicing over, and editing my kata video on
   Langton's ant. I was really happy with how this video turned out, especially with how much cleaner my
   approach to the problem is compared to last week! I think it's very well explained and readable, which
   were both issues I had last week.</p>
  <p>
   I finished my day off by running through everything once more to ensure I am ready for the IPM tomorrow.
   I also spent some time on my Tic Tac Toe assignment setting up some tests that could have existed but
   I didn't make earlier on. It's challenging to set up tests when using a library that displays a GUI; I'd
   like to ask about the best approach to that when I get the chance next.</p>

   Today, I simply picked up where I left off. My main goal was to finish off a GUI and then practice and
   revise a presentation. Additionally, I aimed to reach a good stopping point with a kata, so I could
   practice and record it for a video tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   Finishing my Tic Tac Toe GUI took longer than expected, but I managed to complete it by about
   three-quarters of the way into the day. I encountered some unexpected difficulties regarding how
   it handled the end of the game, and there were some tests that could have been implemented or improved.</p>
  <p>
   With some time remaining in the day, I was able to revise my kata and practice my dialogue a few times.
   I still need to practice my presentation more before I'm ready to showcase it at IPM, but fortunately,
   I have tomorrow to run through it several more times. Additionally, I plan to complete and post my kata
   video tomorrow.</p>

   Going into this week, I have one story fully done. I'd like to practice my presentation each day this week,
   so my plan is to work on each of my other stories until Thursday. I need to implement a GUI for my
   Tic Tac Toe game, which I anticipate will take the most time. Therefore, it is the story I started my day
   with to hit the ground running.</p>
  <p>
   I worked on this implementation throughout the day, and by the end of the day, I was nearly finished with it.
   I probably could have finished, but, as I mentioned, I also wanted to start my presentation work today.
   I found that the most difficult thing about the GUI implementation is noticing SRP violations among my code,
   where it prints information unnecessarily. The function/modules' only purpose is to compute, not print.
   The negative consequence of this is that I need to spend time isolating these print statements into their
   own module that calls either a GUI or a TUI depending on command-line arguments.</p>
  <p>
   To end my day, I worked on my presentation. It's on the Dependency Inversion Principle, which makes
   it the last of the SOLID principles! Reflecting on the time I spent on these principles, I realize
   how much they've helped me improve. I find that the most common principles to follow are the SRP and
   OCP principles; I tend to unintentionally violate those most often. I spent the day putting my slides
   together until I was happy with them, and I wrote up my dialogue script to end the day.</p>

   Today I did two things in particular. The first is lunch and learn. We didn't present a much this week,
   but I did get to watch the craftsmen walk through a server issue. I found that work to be really fascinating
   for my potential future internal development projects. There's a lot of managing EC2 instances,
   something I am actually quite versed in, so I'm looking forward to the day when I get to take a stab
   at some internal work!</p>
  <p>
   The second and last thing I did today was saving game states for my Tic Tac Toe project.
   It was actually not too complicated to get this working. I needed a little research on how
   clojure does file io, but otherwise the implementation was straight forward.</p>
  <p>
   At the end of the day I got it working perfectly with my tests and felt good marking that
   story off before going into my weekend.

   I was quite delighted with how well my IPM went today. Everything was accepted and I got a lot
   of good feedback from my mentors. I appreciated that they took the time to tell me my work is
   satisfactory and that I'm doing well. It gave me a good point of reference for my performance so far.</p>
  <p>
   By the end of the IPM, we planned my next iteration where I got a bunch of new stuff to estimate,
   I'm set on material for the next two and a half weeks. An upcoming assignment is a 3x3x3 board.
   I originally estimated it pretty high due to the weight of my pessimistic guess. When I did the 4x4
   board last week, I took well over the amount of time I estimated, I didn't want to make the same mistake.
   However, on some reflection I realized the big setback for the 4x4 is shared with the 3x3x3, being
   computation time. I think my AI can already handle a 3x3x3 board in terms of time because of the depth
   limit imposed on it, so this assignment may not be as bad as I estimate. I'll likely lower my estimation
   before being assigned it in the coming weeks.</p>
  <p>
   I finished off my day by adding more tests into my tic-tac-toe board that were lacking. I felt
   good at the end of the day about that milestone because I covered a lot of functions that were otherwise
   untested, giving me new confidence in my suite.
