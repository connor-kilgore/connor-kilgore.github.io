   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today was our regular L&L, followed by Internal IPM. I started the morning by pairing with the apprentices
   to push to staging. We found a minor issue with my migrations that got hot-fixed, then we were just
   practiced our demos a bit before Lunch and Learn.</p>
  <p>
   First we had a few presentations from our new apprentices and Brandon. Afterward we did our Friday Fun-time.
   I was the facilitator this week, so I got to choose what game we played. I ended up going with Codenames
   which has been a fan-favorite in the past with everybody.</p>
  <p>
   After a few rounds of codenames we moved onto Internal IPM. There were no issues with the demos and everything
   got accepted! When we moved onto planning next week, we started discussing the new "Weekly" tab that
   would exist on Epic. There was some back and forth debate on how to approach this, which was fun to
   contribute to. Once we finished, I got started on the first one which was the top bar design implementation.
   I didn't get too far with it before the end of the day since I only had about an hour to work on it, but
   it doesn't seem to difficult, I'm should have no issue finishing it Monday.</p>

   This morning, the apprentices and I got together to fix an issue with the master branch of Poker.
   Incidentally I got a little bit confused yesterday and messed something up with pushing that
   lead to needing some rollbacks on GitHub. It was a pain to fix, but we finished after an hour and a half
   or so. I learned a lesson about being more careful and pushing to a separate branch if im not 100%
   that the merge was successful.</p>
  <p>
   After that I got started on my last story for the week which was to make todos in poker more apparent.
   Well funny enough this needs ANOTHER migration, making three this week for me. I had to change how Poker
   stores the number attribute from a long to a float. I figured this out by pairing with Gina.
   We came to a solution to label todos as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. while the stories they were attached
   to were 1, 2, 3, etc. Because of the todos being floats, I had to change the attribute accordingly.
   The migration was a bit tricky, but I got it working fine after some testing.</p>
  <p>
   However, I'd realized that
   floats would not suffice because if a story had 10+ todos, that 1.1, 1.2, soon rolled over to 2.0, 2.1, etc.
   I want it instead to become 1.10 instead of 2, which is why I had to convert the value into a string.
   Thankfully, this was quite easy because I already had the migrations to change to a float. All I had to
   do was change the attribute to type string, tweak a few things, then run the migration again. This fixed
   that unintended behavior.</p>
