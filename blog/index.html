   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   I kicked off today by doing some last minute prep work for my Prime Factors Kata demonstration at our weekly Lunch and Learn.
   I managed to practice it three times and I added in some extra test cases that Micah And Gina tested it on yesterday
   that led to a stack overflow issue. Fortunately my presentation went really well, I addressed the stack overflow issue
   and fixed it. People were impressed with the presentation I gave, and I was given good feedback. All in all, I felt
   good about the demonstration and I can take that confidence into next week!</p>
  <p>
   The rest of the meeting was again seeing some progress reports from my peers. Then we finished it off with a game
   of my choosing because I was the facilitator this week. I went with <a href="https://garticphone.com/">Gartic Phone</a>
   which seemed to be a hit for everyone.</p>
  <p>
   On the second half of my day I watched a few Uncle Bob videos and then dived into my newest kata <b>Coin Changer.</b>
   For my first time practicing it, my main focus was just to solve it, and then optimize my solution as much as possible.
   I found an incredibly simple and elegant solution, therefore, I'm going to spend the next week getting fast at writing
   out the solutions and tests for it. My tests themselves could use work on wording and possible cases.

   Today was a good day! I had my IPM meeting and this time I was able to be fully prepared for it.
   I brought in all my work from the iteration and did really well! It seemed as though Gina and Micah were both
   satisfied with the work I did.</p>
  <p>
   First I presented my Euler problems, they noticed the improvement in the layout,
   tests and quality of the work from last week. I was given suggestions on using threads and tail recursion, both
   things I ended up doing in Euler 12 later today!</p>
  <p> Next I did my Kata which I did really well on, the code just flowed out of my fingertips and gave for a great
  demonstration of mastery at my IPM. The feedback they gave was pretty extensive on this one and I was sure to write
  everything down. It mostly bogged down to making it cleaner and to not pre-factor my steps.</p>
  <p> Last was my SRP presentation. The biggest comment was that I overcomplicated the topic too much. I went too
  into detail on the decoupling strategies and communicated information that was unnecessarily technical. They also
  recommended I add a personal touch to my presentation to be more entertaining for the viewers. Both are things I'll
  be sure to take into my next presentation on Open-Closed Principle. We finished off the meeting by
  planning my next iteration.</p>
  <p> Given that I still had another half-day, I jumped right into my next iteration. First I watched an Uncle Bob video
  on Use Cases, which I found to be quite informative. It left me a good idea on how to approach designing software
  architecturally. I finished my day by doing Euler problem 12 which I managed to add in both thread-first and
  tail-recursion to optimize and clean my code.</p>
