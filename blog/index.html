   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   I left today feeling really accomplished with the work I presented at IPM. Last week could have gone better
   as I've likely mentioned in earlier posts. There was a lot of repeat mistakes I made that I wanted to fix after last
   week's IPM. I feel as though I took a lot of advice and improved on it.</p>
  <p>
   Going into my IPM, I was a bit nervous given last week's result, but I was extra critical with improving
   my entertainment factor, being the ringleader of the meeting, and ensuring that my work is acceptable in
   the parameters I was given. I ended up leaving the meeting with everything being accepted and not
   having to have repeat advice, but instead new constructive criticism to take into my next week!</p>
  <p>
   For this next iteration, I have a lot of additions to add onto my Tic-Tac-Toe board. In theory, they
   don't seem super difficult, but I can tell they are there to challenge my ability to follow the
   SOLID principles better as I continue to design my project. I'd like to refactor some of my old
   code to better follow the discipline as I work on these new tasks.</p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the day I finished up one of the smaller stories I had, which was just adding in
   error messaging on invalid inputs. Then I had enough time to get started on my multiplayer
   implementation which I intend to work on most tomorrow.</p>
