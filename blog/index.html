   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Starting today I got working on a spreadsheet to put together for Tadd. This spreadsheet was a compilation
   of the research I did on Clojure Conj a few months ago. It wasn't really all that difficult to put together
   from the research I had already done. Around the time I'd finished the spreadsheet, I got into a
   pairing with Tadd to go over the work I've done and make edits based on his own understanding of
   what the trip will cost and make adjustments accordingly. This side of the job can be pretty fun sometimes
   to plan and organize trips for other people. This could be something I revisit in the future to
   speak or meet with clients when I'm a craftsman.</p>
  <p>
   In the afternoon I did some finishing touches on the story I worked on yesterday to fix frontend lag with
   the tags. Like I said the solution I found was decent, but I figured there was some more work to be done
   so that's what I focused on.</p>
  <p>
   To finish the day I paired with the other apprentices to push some things on infrastructure, from there
   I was able to better test my changes and see how they perform in a non-local environment. They worked as
   I'd hoped so I ended the day there.

   I felt good going into today having finished my Aesop story yesterday. It was intimidating, but
   I got it done, it'll be a good demo for Friday. I picked up another story that was an investigative
   story on some lag that Epic has around Tags.</p>
  <p>
   I took all day but long story short, the issue with the tags was they didn't update on the client
   end until the push-handler went through. On larger projects this appears delayed giving a lag effect.
   I made the client now update on their end, and send a push update just to speed things up a bit.
   I found a weird inconsistency with how the push-handlers work. Sometimes they get sent very quickly,
   and other times they lag a few hundred milliseconds. This happens for smaller projects too, but those
   few hundred milliseconds are more like 20-30 milliseconds which is imperceptible.</p>
  <p>
   I also found that whenever a push is done, pretty much the entire project is updated which seems
   wasteful, I want to see if it's possible to make updates happen to just the portion that was touched
   instead to preserve resources in larger projects. Tomorrow I'm going to look under the hood of wire
   and see if I can find anything out about these concerns.

   Today is day two, and the last day of implementation of the first step of Aesop.
   I put a lot of effort into getting three features working properly. Fetching all issues,
   creating new issues in bulk format, and editing a single issue.</p>
  <p>
   Fetching issues wasn't all that difficult since I'd mostly finished it up yesterday,
   however I needed some better tests for it which took longer. I was able to use epic and poker
   as guides since I was effectively doing the same thing as them, just for a different API.</p>
  <p>
   By about midday I had some good tests set up, and I started a new test library to simulate
   Jira and Epic entities. With a better foundation I could focus more on the new features.</p>
  <p>
   Naturally the rest of the day was dedicated to creating and editing. I was hoping creating wouldn't
   be as tricky, it did take a little while to get it working how I'd hoped. Editing took
   even longer, but I managed to get everything done and tested by around 5pm. I figured this
   was plenty to constitute a solid barebones step-1 for Aesop, so I pushed to a repo and handed it off
   to greg to get started on step 2.</p>

   This week I'm taking on a new challenge that I've been pretty excited to get started. Last week
   I spiked a story with Greg for a new server that will act as an interface between Epic and Jira
   to tell stories. To start this project, I got to be the one to start the server initially.</p>
  <p>
   Starting off I pulled a template from the clean coders organization and started brainstorming a name
   that I'll pitch this Friday. I ended up going with Aesop after a famous greek fabulist and
   storyteller. The idea is that this project will effectively be a storyteller so the idea seems
   fitting.</p>
  <p>
   My progress was slow today as I was touching some new concepts with what's involved with starting
   a new project on the clean coders stack. I had to figure out what I did and didn't need. I wasted
   some time thinking I'd need a front end but later found out that wouldn't be the case. I ended
   the day with the project set up and having a very informal way to retrieve and display stories.
   I still have some work to do, but it was good work for day one.

   In the morning Greg and I did a quick push to staging for Epic, otherwise I had nothing to do until
   L&L later that morning.</p>
  <p>
   When the weekly meeting started, we got a few classic apprentice presentations that were followed
   by codenames presented by Merl, though he couldn't make it the day of. In fact the whole meeting
   was pretty sparse, seems like the craftsmen are quite busy today.</p>
  <p>
   When IPM finally rolled around, it was just Greg, Tadd and I, for the first half. Tadd isn't super
   technical so while we get to practice demonstrating in layman, there were some things I wanted
   some input from Micah on before proceeding. My demos went great as I'd expected and I got some
   good feedback from Tadd. He seems interested with how Greg and I feel with our growth throughout
   our internal work.</p>
  <p>
   Once Micah had shown up we demoed a few things again back to him for that input I was looking for,
   he gave us a great trajectory for the Jira stories next week. I'm looking forward to jumping into
   them on Monday!</p>

   Today Greg and I spent most of the day on a confetti fountain story. I've been wanting to
   try this story since I have been left out working on other stuff in the past. It'll be nice
   to do a fun story like this as a breather on the story I was otherwise struggling on.</p>
  <p>
   Needless to say, this ended up being a lot of fun playing with the animation and getting it
   to behave like a confetti fountain. We had a really nice display by about midday which
   put us way ahead of schedule on this story. There were a couple of optimizations we had to
   wrap up, but we finished this story with no issues really.</p>
  <p>
   For the next hour or so I focused on the bug story I made last week for the poker todos.
   I found that there was an actual bug where it wasn't sending over todos properly under a
   specific context. I hot-fixed it and couldn't find any other issues thankfully.</p>
  <p>
   For the rest of the day, I focused on trying to finish up the story I worked on yesterday.
   I had nearly finished but ran into an issue that I got stuck on. I paired with Alex J. for a bit,
   he came up with a great solution for my problem. Though I worked a few hours over I finished
   this story perfectly! It felt good to end the day finishing the amount of work I did this week,
   I'm stoked to present my demos tomorrow.
