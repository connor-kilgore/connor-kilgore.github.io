   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Today is the day I got introduced to internal dev. I was nervous but equally excited to finally start doing
   some internal dev work for the company!</p>
  <p>
   In the morning I started with a little bit of work on my tests, I didn't get too far before lunch and learn,
   I did get a few tests knocked out that contributed to this story.</p>

  <p>
   I spent the next three hours at Lunch and Learn and internal IPM. Lunch and learn we did a new game that was
   developed by the Jensen's again, like Scattergories. It was a card game that I played a very long time ago as
   a kid, it was pretty nostalgic for me. There was also a few first-time presentations from the new apprentices
   that I quite enjoyed. It was a reflective activity for me to observe how newer employees approached their first
   few presentations, just like me back in February.</p>

  <p>
   After L&L, I moved onto internal IPM. We spent a lot of time looking at current features and deciding what work
   needs to be done, what the priorities are, and estimating time on each story. I ended up working with Greg during
   IPM to estimate each story and I intend to reach out to him or my mentor if I'm ever needing extra help on this work.
   My first internal dev tasks are to fix some bugs that seem like relatively simple fixes.</p>

  <p>For the rest of my day I ended up noticing that one of my supposed "small" stories ended up having a more
  involved acceptance criteria than I'd anticipated. I needed to consolidate options into my tic-tac-toe game and
  make it so the AI moves automatically without additional user input. I worked on that for the rest of the day but
  didn't quite finish which I plan to do over the weekend to make up lost time.</p>

   Today I had two choices ahead of me, work on testing, or making sure my ttt-web can still be integrated with my new
   updated features. I chose to focus on the latter and do a little bit of extra dev work on it.</p>
  <p>
   The tricky thing about my ttt-web project is I never actually finished it, we ended up moving on before I had the
   chance to. To compensate I'd like to put some work into it so that my presentation of its integration with my
   updated ttt still works. At its current state, it's not very presentable. I focused on this for the first half
   of the day until I found a good stopping point. I did a little bit of work on making the menu selection work
   better, but I still have to make the game itself work.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of my day I jumped into improving my ClojureScript tests. I started with some of the suggestions
   that Micah made during my IPM yesterday to get a good idea and flow and then starting working away. By the end of the
   day I had vastly improved my tests. They were not quite done yet, but nonetheless better.

   Going into my IPM I was very satisfied to finally get this ClojureScript project finished. I've been
   struggling on it for two weeks, I'm glad to finally hit acceptance criteria. That being said, my mentors did
   have a lot to say about my project and the work that needed to be done on it. Particularly I fell short on
   testing. A lot of my tests were big blobs that were hard to read and through this project I think I just forgot
   about making tests well-written prose. There-fore a bigger task for me is to go back and make all my tests look
   good, readable, and fully involved for this project. In total, they gave me 6 points this week to cover the
   remainder of phase 3 of my apprenticeship. The remaining 4 points I'll receive on Friday for internal dev work!</p>
  <p>
   For the remainder of the day I focused on knocking out a bunch of small stories I have that are 0.25-0.5 points each.
   By the end of the day I'd finished all of them, I'm happy with where I'm at before ending my day.</p>

   Starting this week refreshed from my three-day weekend I spent the day fixing up the last few remaining features
   of my TTT game. I'm pleased to announce I've finally finished this project after struggling on it for
   quite a long time. I put in some good unit tests, the design is intuitive and the game works just as expected.
   I'm definitely ready to show what I've got at my IPM tomorrow!</p>

   Today was the wrap-up of my main implementation onto of my stateless ClojureScript TTT game. I got almost entirely
   finished but there was still some wrap-ups I had left to do, I'm going to save those for Tuesday before my
   IPM.</p>
  <p>
   In the morning I got started on things, in particular I designed the grids for my TicTacToe game in the web-ui
   format, I'm quite pleased with how it looks and the user-input is fairly intuitive.</p>
  <p>
   Next on my agenda was Lunch and Learn, I was in charge of facilitating the game, therefore I spent some time
   ensuring I had a game that would be fun for everybody. Initially I was going to repeat a game played earlier on
   but I decided to go with a JackBox game that I happen to own.</p>
  <p>
   After Lunch and Learn I spent the rest of the day on my ClojureScript project. It mostly works but there's still
   some things I'd like to fix up, as I mentioned I'm going to fix them up on Tuesday after memorial-day weekend.

   My focus today was understanding Reagent much more deeply since I rushed myself to get this project
   done before my IPM. I clearly didn't understand it well enough to be confident using it.</p>
  <p>
   For the morning I took time looking at Reagent materials and tutorials to ensure I know how it works. My biggest
   issue was I misunderstood the use of the render function and ratoms. Micah talked about this a little bit yesterday.
   I assumed rendering had to be recalled each update, but it acts more as an event driven listener that waits for
   updates in a specified ratom to update itself. It took some fiddling, but eventually I got my project restructured
   to use rendering and ratoms properly.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day I got my menu put in for my TicTacToe game, and I worked on the board a little bit.
   I am very close to being done I just need a few more implementations and tests for this project to finally be done
   with the coding part. Afterward I need to put it on my blog to be a fully usable stateless TTT game.

   My IPM went as expected. I had to explain my situation to my mentor and go back and get this project finished
   for good. Micah gave me some good tips on project flow and how I can properly use Reagent since I was doing
   some things wrong.</p>
  <p>
   During the meeting my project encountered some build issues that needed to be resolved so that's what I
   focused on for the rest of the day. It took some playing around, but eventually I got things working okay.
   I seem to be dealing with an issue where the project sometimes compiles wrong and doesn't see certain files
   when it should. I found a workaround by using the dev build and the script in my dev project to get it to
   properly see my TicTacToe files and everything seems to work just fine!
