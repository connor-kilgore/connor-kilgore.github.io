   Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
   for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
   after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
   what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   Going into today I had one thing to focus on and that was my stateless ttt webpage. I found that progress
   could have gone faster, but I think I hit an okay stopping point for the day.</p>
  <p>
   In particular, I had to do a lot of making shifting my code over to compilable javascript.
   The process of this was a little difficult due to the fact that a lot of tools for getting that to
   work along with speclj were pretty outdated and hard to get information on. However, by about midday
   I had things working as I'd hoped which is good!</p>
  <p>
   There was a serious constraint however, I could not get all the tools for deploying and using TDD
   working on an updated version of closure, it's forcing me to use a pretty outdated version. Tomorrow
   I'm going to ask for help on resolving this issue since I couldn't seem to find a solid solution.</p>
  <p>
   Within my limitation I decided to focus more on the implementation which involved created the new
   ui output for my TTT game. I had to do a bit of research on how to use JavaScript again. I'm happy
   with what I figured out I had enough time in the rest of my day to implement a few methods!

   To start off today, I had a plan of finishing my abstract factory presentation. If I can do that, I'm
   in a good spot to get my ClojureScript project done tomorrow, and finish my last presentation on Wednesday
   in time for IPM.</p>
  <p>
   I am noticing I'm a bit behind due to the push on my last IPM, I still have 10 points of work this week
   but effectively 8 points of time because I lost a whole day. I will remember if this happens in the future
   so that I can bring it to my mentor's attention ahead of time.</p>
  <p>
   Throughout the day, I put my slides together with the research I compiled. I used lots of graphics to
   get across my point and I like the flow of my dialogue. I ended the day by running through it quite a few times
   till I could get through the presentation without following my script. I'll continue to practice
   as the week progresses. Here's an example of a graphic I used!

   I kicked off today with my IPM early in the morning. There wasn't any coding projects so the acceptance
   criteria was much easier to hit than usual. I got everything accepted with no problems, which felt great.
   Micah also suggested I share the Clojure Con 2024 research with Tadd.</p>
  <p>
   After Lunch and Learn I decided to jump into one of my stories which was a presentation on Abstract
   Factories. I did some preliminary research and re-watched the Clean Code video to get a solid understanding
   of the subject. I wrote down some solid notes for Monday and that's how I ended my day. I'm still game
   planning how I want to approach this topic since I don't want to rehash too much information from my last
   presentation.

   This morning I was notified that my IPM would be pushed to tomorrow. I didn't have much to do, and both
   Gina and Micah were pretty busy today, therefore I decided to just run through all my projects today
   and make the quality of my work even better. I re-watched some design pattern videos that I still
   could use a little more understanding on, and otherwise I ran fixed up my presentation with Merl bit by
   bit.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of the day, Merl and I practiced our dialogue together for when we present at tomorrow's
   Lunch and Learn. We decided to do a little playful conversation for our presentation which I think really
   helps with the entertainment factor. We are both super confident with the quality of our presentation
   for tomorrow.</p>

   I have to finish off my iteration today. To do so I completed three things. The first was
   my spike research on ClojureScript. I looked at some videos on the topic and found the transfer over
   to ClojureScript from my original Clojure TTT code was not super complicated. I did however have to
   factor in the extension of behavior so that my code would display as a web-ui, that along with considering
   any complication made me put my Clojure Script story at 4 points for next week.</p>
  <p>
   For the second half of my day, I started by finishing off my Clojure Con research. I had everyone's
   responses for my Google form and was able to do some rough calculations on flight costs and
   chart everyone's availability for the event.</p>
  <p>
   Finishing off my day, I ran through my presentation just a few more times to get ready for my IPM
   Tomorrow!</p>
