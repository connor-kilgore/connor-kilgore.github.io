This game is my latest project and unfinished. I have been working on this game since September 2021.
The most major thing to come out of this game is integrating it into a YouTube series designed to be
both educational, and for entertainment purposes. Additionally, I have developed a new and unique
form of "quick time event" that involves communicating from client to server to client in order to
create user created prompts that must be returned by the receiving client. This idea is currently
under development but in the pursuit of that I have learned to make typical quick time events.
