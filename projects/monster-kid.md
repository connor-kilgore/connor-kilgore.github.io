After my learning experience with King's Reach I sought after Monster Kid as a first real attempt
at creating a game suited for the market on Roblox. This was developed over six months from December
2020 to June 2021. This is a mini-game style game designed to have re-playability value.
The main things I learned from this game was picking up skills outside my expertise and
creating a lobby/matchmaking system that can start and end games.
What I mean by new skills is that I was heavily encumbered by my inability to create unique
and professional models in my previous game. I don't have anyone that I can reliably work with to
handle that more artistic area, so I took the time to practice and learn how to develop models on my own.
Everything in Monster Kid is completely original and made by me, that includes the items, player models,
the map and even the GUI. The only thing that wasn't made by me was the games thumbnail which I
coordinated
with someone on Fiverr to make.
The lobby system is a seemingly simple, but surprisingly complicated system that I designed. It has to
intake all the players in the game, randomly select one as the monster, and teleport the players
accordingly.
During this teleport the game also has to set up the map properly and change the player model of the
monster.
These are the obvious changes I list, but it actually does a number more of things during this teleport.
Additionally, when the game ends, everything has to be reset to base state so that no errors occur when
the
teleport is reinitialized. The debugging process on this was long and took coordinators to help me with
hours of just sitting in the lobby and letting me observe the errors that may show up.
