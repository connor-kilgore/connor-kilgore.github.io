    <p>My capstone project was easily the most valuable learning experience I have under my belt. I tackled new
        things outside of my comfort zone.
        This project consisted of a yelp-like app that focuses more on accesibility and demographics when measuring
        the quality of local businesses.
        I worked on a team of five people called Inclusive Solutions and our app was called <b>welcomed.</b></p>
    <p>The first new thing for me was leadership, I was put on a team with four other people and I stepped up as the
        team lead, a role I was otherwise keen
        to avoiding. I decided to challenge myself with this position. As a team, we dealt with setbacks such as the
        disappearance of a member that caused
        serious harm to our progress as a group. As the team lead I put time into organizing and making decisions on
        how to move forward so that our team
        can be as successful as possible. At some point, my leadership position wasn't just assigned, but earned
        among my peers. They trusted and relied
        on me to make final decisions and assign them their next task. I additionally served as the main point of
        contact between my team and our client
        to organize meetings and keep a good relationship.</p>
    <p>The technical challenges I faced were challenging but fascinating and sparked my interest in backend
        development. I was in charge of setting
        up our Amazon Web Server EC2 instance, This gave me experience with AWS management, setting up and using
        database systems and networking. I accomplished This
        with a MySQL server hosted on the EC2 instance along with From there I set up
        a MySQL database that harbors the data in our entire project, along with it's schema. Lastly, I set up a
        java server that runs around the clock using systemctl
        and accepts client socket connections to send data to and from the database.
