My capstone project was easily the most valuable learning experience I have under my belt. I tackled new
things outside of my comfort zone.
This project consisted of a yelp-like app that focuses more on accesibility and demographics when measuring
the quality of local businesses.
I worked on a team of five people called Inclusive Solutions and our app was called **welcomed.**
The first new thing for me was leadership, I was put on a team with four other people and I stepped up as the
team lead, a role I was otherwise keen
to avoiding. I decided to challenge myself with this position. As a team, we dealt with setbacks such as the
disappearance of a member that caused
serious harm to our progress as a group. As the team lead I put time into organizing and making decisions on
how to move forward so that our team
can be as successful as possible. At some point, my leadership position wasn't just assigned, but earned
among my peers. They trusted and relied
on me to make final decisions and assign them their next task. I additionally served as the main point of
contact between my team and our client
to organize meetings and keep a good relationship.
The technical challenges I faced were challenging but fascinating and sparked my interest in backend
development. I was in charge of setting
up our Amazon Web Server EC2 instance, This gave me experience with AWS management, setting up and using
database systems and networking. I accomplished This
with a MySQL server hosted on the EC2 instance along with From there I set up
a MySQL database that harbors the data in our entire project, along with it's schema. Lastly, I set up a
java server that runs around the clock using systemctl
and accepts client socket connections to send data to and from the database.
