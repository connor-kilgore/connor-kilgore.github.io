During my time at university, I participated in a graphics elective that involved generating images in C from
scratch with raytracing.
The images shown are two of my final projects. The one of the left features a fully ray-traced project that
includes, color, light sources,
diffusion, refraction and reflection to generate shapes given an input text file. The image on the right
takes the ideas from the left image
and extends it by make a stereoscopic image, or also known as a red-blue 3D image.

<div class="image-row">
  <img src="/assets/photos/output.png" alt="output" width="300" />
  <img src="/assets/photos/3Doutput.jpg" alt="3D output" width="300" />
</div>

There are also a few examples from my Roblox games that involved raytracing by casting rays from the user
mouse cursor onto a 3D environment
in order to allow item placement.
