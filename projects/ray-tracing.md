    <p>During my time at university, I participated in a graphics elective that involved generating images in C from
        scratch with raytracing.
        The images shown are two of my final projects. The one of the left features a fully raytraced project that
        includes, color, light sources,
        diffusion, refraction and reflection to generate shapes given an input text file. The image on the right
        takes the ideas from the left image
        and extends it by make a stereoscopic image, or also known as a red-blue 3D image.

    <p>There are also a few examples from my Roblox games that involved raytracing by casting rays from the user
        mouse cursor onto a 3D environment
        in order to allow item placement.
