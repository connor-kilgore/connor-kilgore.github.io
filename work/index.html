			<p>"Kings Reach" is the first game I developed on Roblox. The development of this game took place over
			six months from May to November of 2020.</p>
			<p>This game more than anything was a learning process for me, it was my first exposure to self projects
			and discoverig the process of researching and problem solving without guidance from professors
			or mentors. Using the platform that Roblox provides and the coding language was all new to me and I racked up
			hundreds of hours just surfing through forums, online tutorials, and practicing.</p>
			<p> Kings Reach features elements of ray tracing, saving model location data using algebra-based formulas,
			and utilizing built in services provided by Roblox.</p>
			<p> If I were to go back to this game I would change a few things. First I would improve the system that
			saves model location data because it is only compatible with models that are loaded onto four different
			angles: 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. With improvement in the formula used, any angle should be compatible
			when loading the models. Additionally I would remove the models I used in this game from an online database
			and recreate them as my own custom models.
