				<p>"Kings Reach" is the first game I developed on Roblox. The development of this game took place over
				six months from May to November of 2020. This game is an RPG style community interaction game.</p>
				<p>This game more than anything was a learning process for me, it was my first exposure to self projects
				and discovering the process of researching and problem solving without guidance from professors
				or mentors. Using the platform that Roblox provides as well as the coding language was all new to me and I racked up
				hundreds of hours just surfing through forums, online tutorials, and practicing.</p>
				<p> Kings Reach features elements of ray tracing, saving model location data using algebra-based formulas,
				and utilizing built in services provided by Roblox.</p>
				<p> If I were to go back to this game I would change a few things. First I would improve the system that
				saves model location data because it is only compatible with models that are loaded onto four different
				angles: 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. With improvement in the formula used, any angle should be compatible
				when loading the models. Additionally I would remove the models I used in this game from an online database
				and recreate them as my own custom models.

			<section class="monsterKidText">
				<p>"After my learning experience with King's Reach I sought after Monster Kid as a first real attempt
				at creating a game suited for the market on Roblox. This was developed over six months from December
				2020 to June 2021. This is a mini-game style game designed to have replayability value.</p>
				<p>The main things I learned from this game was picking up skills outside outside of my expertise,
				creating a lobby/matchmaking system that can start and end games, and pressing my game onto social
				media platforms.<p>
				<p> What I mean by new skills is that I was heavily encumbered by my inability to create unique
				and professional models in my previous game. I don't have anyone that I can reliably work with to
				handle that more artistic area so I took the time to practice and learn how to develop models on my own.
				Everything in Monster Kid is completely original and made by me, that includes the items, player models,
				the map and even the GUI. The only thing that wasn't made by me was the games thumbnail which I coordinated
				with someone on Fiverr to make.</p>
				<p> The lobby system is a seemingly simple but surprisingly complicated system that I designed. It has to
				intake all the players in the game, randomly select the designated monster, and teleport the players accordingly.
				During this teleport the game also has to set up the map properly and change the player model of the monster.
				These are the obvious changes I list, but it actually does a number more of things during this teleport.
				Additionally when the game ends, everything has to be reset to base state so that no errors occur when the
				teleport is reinitialized. The debugging process on this was long and took coordinators to help me with
				hours of just sitting in the lobby and letting me observe the errors that may show up.</p>
				<p> Dealing with social media is also something I would apply to out of my comfort zone skills.
				It took lots of research on what the best ways were to get players to notice my game, some of the strategies
				I tried included making a trailer for my game, posting consistently on Reddit about it and creating a discord
				server to maintain a community around my games. </p>
