			<h2> About </h2>
			<p>Hello! my name is Connor Kilgore, I am an american software developer. I am studying for my
			BA in computer science at <a href="https://www.nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a>. I am particularly interested
			in full stack development and most proficient in Java.</p>
			<p> Outside of school work, I am passionate about my personal computer science related projects. Particularly
			I like to make games on the platform <a href="https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a>. More information on that can
			be seen in my "Work" section.</p>
			<p> I also have many hobbies, I love to play video games, watch horror movies and anime, read sci-fi fantasy
			novels, and learn about astronomy.</p>
