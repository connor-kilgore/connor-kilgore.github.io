Going into today I had one thing to focus on and that was my stateless ttt webpage. I found that progress
could have gone faster, but I think I hit an okay stopping point for the day.

In particular, I had to do a lot of making shifting my code over to compilable javascript.
The process of this was a little difficult due to the fact that a lot of tools for getting that to
work along with speclj were pretty outdated and hard to get information on. However, by about midday
I had things working as I'd hoped which is good!

There was a serious constraint however, I could not get all the tools for deploying and using TDD
working on an updated version of closure, it's forcing me to use a pretty outdated version. Tomorrow
I'm going to ask for help on resolving this issue since I couldn't seem to find a solid solution.

Within my limitation I decided to focus more on the implementation which involved created the new
ui output for my TTT game. I had to do a bit of research on how to use JavaScript again. I'm happy
with what I figured out I had enough time in the rest of my day to implement a few methods!
