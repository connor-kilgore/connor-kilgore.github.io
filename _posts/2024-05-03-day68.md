Starting this week I had no actual programming projects, everything I have to do is about
research and presenting. I have a lot of videos on Design patterns to watch so that's going to
be my main focus for this week.

I started off today with one video and then went into our weekly Lunch and Learn. We had a good amount of
internal dev this week, it was pretty interesting to listen in on what everyone is working on.
After the meeting ended, I had lunch and ended my day with a few more design pattern videos.
