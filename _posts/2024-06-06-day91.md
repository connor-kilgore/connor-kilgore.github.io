Going into today I had to focus on fixing the point story inaccuracy story. This is a bug where Epic calculates
full points for a user of any given story even if they only contributed half of it for example. My goal today
is to fix this issue and have it properly calculate half credit if the user only did half the story.

I started the day by pairing with Merl, we got to work trying to understand where the bug lies and how we can
fix it. After not too long we isolated where the issue lies however solving it was another issue.
We ended up pairing with Greg for a little additional advice and by the end of the day this story was completed!
All we need now is to push to staging before IPM tomorrow.
