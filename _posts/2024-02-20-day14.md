I started this morning by going through another Uncle Bob video. Today's episode was the **Interface Segregation
Principle** which I found to be quite informative. The biggest take-away was the idea of separating fat classes into
a more abstract set of interfaces to make the code have to run and compile much less each time, savings hours of
compiling time. I quite liked the idea of this practice and hope to get good at it soon.

The next portion of my day was spent getting my Open-Closed Principle presentation ready to go. I am happy with
the slides and examples I've provided, and my dialogue is solid too. After a few practices I've managed to get
pretty close to five minutes on my presentation. Tomorrow I'm going to go over it a few more times and polish some
things up, so it's ready for my IPM on Thursday.

I finished up my day with my two kata's. The prime factors kata I finalized the video and published it to YouTube,
I am quite happy with how it turned out. My coin changer kata I practiced a handful more times this afternoon to
end my day. I am quite confident with how well I can demonstrate it, and plan to get better before Thursday.
