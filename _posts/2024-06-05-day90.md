I am happy to say I've completed phase 3 of my apprenticeship today! I got everything ready for my IPM and met all
my acceptance criteria with flying colors. During the IPM Micah had me think reflectively on how my new-found
architectural strategies help my programs be consistently flexible with each additional change in behavior.
This has always been a setback for me in the past, it's satisfying to overcome this hardship finally.

In the afternoon I started working on my internal dev story by myself. I spent a lot of time just trying to
understand the system, just like yesterday. Most of my efforts were put on just reading through the system,
understanding how each thing works. I'm slow with reading all this unfamiliar code but slowly getting better
as I become more familiar. The story I'm currently working on is to fix the create-and-label bug. Around the
end of the day I ended up pairing with Greg and Merl to get this story finished! Mostly Greg helped us
through the code, I'd love to get more autonomous!
