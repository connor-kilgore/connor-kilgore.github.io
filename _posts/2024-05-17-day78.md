Starting my next iteration fresh I started this morning with some last minute practice on my presentation
for lunch and learn today. I revised a few things just before presenting, but that fortunately wasn't
a problem.

Today during lunch and learn I got to meet the now newest apprentice Michael, also known as Scoops.
He seems like a nice guy and I look forward to getting to know him better as he continues his
journey at Clean Coders.

For our game this week we did a spy game which I found quite fun! I think I've played it in the past,
but it's been a long time, it was a nice throw-back for me.

After Lunch and Learn and a short lunch break I focused on my continued issue the ClojureScript project,
I'm happy to say I made good progress and actually got stuff compiling today! I'm hoping on Monday I can
wrap up these issues and focus on the implementation finally.
