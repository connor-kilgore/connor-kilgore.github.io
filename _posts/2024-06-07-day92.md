I started off this morning by getting everything pushed to staging with Gina's help. She showed me how to use
infrastructure a little bit so once I have access I'll be able to do this stuff myself. I had about an hour to
prepare for L&L which I spent making sure I know exactly what I'm presenting and having a before and after to show
that the problems I addressed were fixed.

Going into L&L I got to see a few presentations from the newer apprentices and also play a dwarf mining game
courtesy of Alex Root-Roach putting it together as the facilitator. Afterward, I moved onto IPM which ended up
lasting quite a while, I enjoyed presenting what I had and going through a bunch of stories to estimate them
with Greg and Merl for the following week.

After a short lunch break I had some time to get started on a story involved with adding a loading spinner to
acceptance criteria. I managed to isolate the issue before I called it a day.
