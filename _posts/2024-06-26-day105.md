I did one thing today. I finished this Speclj Bug story after my two weeks of effort. I kept working towards
my strategy that I'd put together yesterday. By the end of the day I had this new library working completely!
It also just innately fixed the original bug which was the space directory issue. Ending today on
fixing something that has been an issue for two weeks was a big win for me!

That being said near the end of the day I had uncovered a new issue that was caused by my
changes in Speclj. Other projects that used Speclj were now not loading in source files in the
proper order, specifically if those namespaces were referenced through file path instead of
requiring them. I'm unsure of a solution and I'd like to talk to my mentor about it tomorrow.
