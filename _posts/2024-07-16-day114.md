This morning I was able to finish up the last of this route checking story. I ran into a small setback
which was refactoring how this function passes in parameters, since it relies on a specific context
of handlers to work properly. My fix was to just have the handlers be passed in when the function
is called. I don't think this is a perfect solution, but certainly good enough for now. Once I had
finished I just had to create the pull request and wait on someone to accept it, so I could update
the other projects, an otherwise trivial task.

In the afternoon I started a story that I knew was going to be tough, which was the retroactive
adding of todos on Poker. The initial issue was that Epic passes its stories to Poker, but not its todos
on an initial sync. Fixing this sounds simple but there was also an issue with Epic just sending
raw stories, and expecting Poker to know how to convert them. This certainly violates a few
principles and needs to be reworked. I spent the rest of the day working on this refactoring and had
a decent solution by the end of the day. Epic now converts stories into poker stories before sending
them over.
