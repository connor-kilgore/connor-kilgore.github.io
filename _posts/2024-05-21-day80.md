Today I put all my focus into my ClojureScript TTT implementation. I had a decent start in the morning because I
resolved a few lingering issues with my setup, however they took up more time than I'd hoped throughout the day
seeing as I only have until tomorrow to get this done.

Those issues included trying to get Reagent imported into my system properly, and having a proper run file instead
of just a dev file for testing. I took a wrong turn with Reagent and ended up wasting some extra time but by
midday I had everything working.

In the afternoon I ended up finding out how involved Reagent can be for this project. I hacked at getting the new
UI working for the rest of the day, but I just didn't finish on time, I had to let my Mentors know of my situation.
I think where I went wrong was I thought I could use the UI synchronously with my program like the TUI performs, but
JavaScript, and therefore ClojureScript is inherently asynchronous. If I had another day or two to rethink
and refactor my strategy I could get this program finally complete. For now, I'll show them what I have at IPM
tomorrow.
