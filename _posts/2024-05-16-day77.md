I went into IPM today knowing that I didn't have something done, but as I mentioned previously,
I've been fairly open about this being difficult so fortunately at least me being behind wasn't
a surprise.

Micah was held back in another meeting, so it was just me and Gina, we spent a good while pairing trying
to resolve some of the major issues I've been dealing with so that I can get this story done and working
properly.

After we finished pairing I took a lunch break then jumped into a call with the new apprentice Alex
to say hi. He works in a sun-room in his home which compared to my often dimly lit studio apartment,
makes me jealous.

After talking to Alex I did some work on my ClojureScript story to try and start fresh, Gina recommended
I just start with a Hello World project and build my way up so that I'm not encountering major amounts
of errors at once.

I finished my day by pairing with Merl, so we could give each other pointers on our presentations that we
are presenting tomorrow. We cover the same topics, but we took different approaches on what information
we wanted to convey, I think it will really help make our presentations not monotonous at Lunch and
Learn tomorrow.
