Today I did two things in particular. The first is lunch and learn. We didn't present a much this week,
but I did get to watch the craftsmen walk through a server issue. I found that work to be really fascinating
for my potential future internal development projects. There's a lot of managing EC2 instances,
something I am actually quite versed in, so I'm looking forward to the day when I get to take a stab
at some internal work!

The second and last thing I did today was saving game states for my Tic Tac Toe project.
It was actually not too complicated to get this working. I needed a little research on how
clojure does file io, but otherwise the implementation was straight forward.

At the end of the day I got it working perfectly with my tests and felt good marking that
story off before going into my weekend.
