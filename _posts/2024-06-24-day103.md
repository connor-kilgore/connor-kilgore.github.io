I started the week by fixing a bug very quickly. I thought it would be an easy story and a good
way to start my week with a win to glide me through my upcoming harder work. This was a fix to make
it so that collapsed views on Epic didn't have scroll arrows below them anymore. All I had to do
was not have them render when they are collapsed and fix up a couple tests to represent that.

For the rest of the day I focused again on my speclj bug problem. I spent most of that time studying
and trying to understand a possible solution for the atoms getting blown away when the files are freshened.
I got a little bit of progress and understanding, but I still had a ways to go. I made some minor changes
at the end of the day to test some of my theories but had not luck, unfortunately. Tomorrow I plan to
pair with Brandon to see if he has a good input since he has done a lot of work on Speclj in the past.
