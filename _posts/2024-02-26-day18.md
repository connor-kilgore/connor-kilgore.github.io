I felt good after today. This week I have a Tic Tac Toe assignment that is the largest thing I've done in clojure.
It's giving me a lot of room for practice and learning because I now have to manage namespaces and dependencies,
but I'm also doing a more involved project with TDD. I am really appreciating the moments where my tests are
all running, and as a result my program works as I expect. It is a huge improvement from the first time
I did this project. It is also incredibly helpful with breaking down the problem into smaller functions. Especially
for developing an unbeatable algorithm. When I coded it in java, it was a very long function with multiple loops and
lists that constantly changed, needless to say it doesn't translate over to Clojure easily. But I am making sure
enough progress because I got about half of the algorithm to work as I'd hoped, tomorrow I am wanting to finish
this project off, and start polishing it.

I ended my day by doing some additional research on the Liskov Substitution Principle since not only will I want
to apply it to my Tic Tac Toe project, but I have to put together a presentation on the subject. Then I found a few
ways to improve my coin changer Kata before the end of the day. Tomorrow I plan to put a lot more into these two
stories, so I am confident in them and I have them ready for Thursday.
