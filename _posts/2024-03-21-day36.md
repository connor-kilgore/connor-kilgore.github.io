Today was my IPM, and I was very happy with how things turned out. The highlight of my demonstrations
was definitely my presentation on the dependency inversion principle. This was one of my better presentations,
as it was entertaining, insightful, and easy to understand, thanks to my easy-to-follow diagrams. I also had a
very in-depth understanding of this concept compared to the other principles I have presented on in the past.

By the end of the meeting, I received my assignments for the next week. In particular,
the 3x3x3 board is something I have ahead of me that I anticipate will be quite difficult. However,
for today, I need to focus on my technical debt. This involves refactoring old code that is deteriorating
due to my efforts to improve the overall design. I have code in my tic-tac-toe assignment that dates back
as far as a month ago at this point. Specifically, I need to focus on completely separating my user
interfaces from computation code. Currently, my code is littered with UI checks, which make the structure
ugly and rigid. After a few hours, I managed to separate things neatly to call the user interface when
necessary and avoid Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) violations.
