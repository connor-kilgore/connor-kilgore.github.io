Today, I aimed to tackle all the minor tasks so that I wouldn't have much else to focus on.
My primary focus was on completing my video for the bowling game kata, followed by watching
the remaining videos on component design.

I completed the video sooner than anticipated, which allowed me to invest additional time in
improving and rehearsing my kata. Following the advice given during my IPM yesterday, I first
restructured my tests to adhere to a proper test structure with **Build**, **Operate**,
and **Check** attributes. Additionally, I revamped my kata to be more polymorphic and object-oriented.
After primarily using Clojure in recent months, I found myself slipping out of Java habits, so this
served as a valuable refresher.

Afterward, I delved into the video production process. This segment wasn't too challenging;
I simply had to record, add voice-over, and edit, which only took a few hours to complete. By
the end, I still had some time left to watch the Component Design Videos.

Needless to say, I am struggling a bit to understand the concepts from Component Design.
I want to do some more research and understanding on the subject before I complete the tests.
