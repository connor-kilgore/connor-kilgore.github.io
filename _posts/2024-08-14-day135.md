Like I mentioned yesterday, I started this morning by pairing with Brandon. He naturally had a lot of things to
say about the code I had which led to a ton of refactors that had me working on this for the rest of the day.
First issue I found was that members need to be deleted if they overlap with existing members of the super-user.
We also found that my tests could have more coverage over specific edge cases I didn't think about.</p>

After a few hours, we did a deploy and tested it with Brandon's account but as we did it I realized we had
forgot about another edge case that needed to be reworked. This edge case was a tough fix but necessary.
By the end of the day it was working as intended, in the morning I plan to deploy to prod and get Micah's
accounts synced up.
