Continuing from where I left off yesterday, I dedicated today to crossing off more items from my feature list.
With only two days remaining until my IPM, I aimed to wrap up comfortably by tomorrow.

The initial task I tackled was setting the root directory. Thankfully,
I had already implemented argument parsing last Friday, so it was just a matter of passing the
root directory through to where it retrieves files. After about an hour of tinkering, I
successfully got it to work as intended!

The remainder of the day was dedicated to working on the guessing game feature. It turned out to be a more
challenging implementation than I had anticipated. While I feel like I'm close to completion, I
didn't quite finish it today. One major hurdle I encountered was figuring out how to maintain a
continuous connection between the web browser and the server. Without this, there's a risk of data
being lost or mixed up between users. Unfortunately, there isn't much documentation available on this
aspect, so I'll give it another shot tomorrow. If I can't get it to work, I'll have to brainstorm a
workaround solution.
