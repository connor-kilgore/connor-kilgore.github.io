Starting this week refreshed from my three-day weekend I spent the day fixing up the last few remaining features
of my TTT game. I'm pleased to announce I've finally finished this project after struggling on it for
quite a long time. I put in some good unit tests, the design is intuitive and the game works just as expected.
I'm definitely ready to show what I've got at my IPM tomorrow!
