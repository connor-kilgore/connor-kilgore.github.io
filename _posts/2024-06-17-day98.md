Monday I'm coming back from a week at my parent's house so now I can work back in my usual environment.
I feel refreshed, relaxed, and ready to go! Starting today I worked with Merl a bit on the tooltips story
from last Friday.

Merl and I spent a good bit of time on this story due to just having issues with the CSS. We ended up having
to get Olive involved to get a redesign of how these tooltips worked because they weren't consistent in
every context of them showing up on the webpage. By the end of the day Olive had given a good design that
I followed and got working fully to be pushed to staging.

I spent the second half of my day, particularly while Olive was doing her redesign, to focus on this
Speclj bug. This story wasn't finished last week, so I'm hoping to use the time I have now to come up
with a good solution. After half a day of playing with it and attempting to learn the code I found something
out. The describe macros are what's in charge of getting the descriptions to
print out. When the files are reloaded, the describes are submitted and stored in an atom to be printed
thereafter, along with all of their tests.
