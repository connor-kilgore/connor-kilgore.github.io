I felt good coming out of IPM today. Having such a huge 10-point assignment be accepted all at once is
somewhat satisfying. However, they gave me work to do for this week on my HTTP Server. The biggest point
out was that I didn't test my server nearly enough. I had anticipated this going into the meeting because
of the time constraints that prevented me from fully testing my project. I also had issues coming up with
solutions for how to test side effects rather than exact return values. Micah pointed out something that
really made sense with how I should go forward. By strictly following TDD, I'm also forcing myself to follow
the SOLID principles. It was not something I'd considered in the past, but it makes sense. A lot of my would-be
tests were impossible due to not following the basic rules of SOLID like dependency inversion.

I spent the second half of my day jumping into restructuring my project to have fully involved tests.
After a few hours, I realized I had definitely underestimated how long this would take. I've only finished
off one file, and that took me hours. Mostly, there was lots of time working out how I would test for side
effects. I'm hoping once I get over that learning curve, the rest of the test setup will go faster.
