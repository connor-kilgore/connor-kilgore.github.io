My IPM went as expected. I had to explain my situation to my mentor and go back and get this project finished
for good. Micah gave me some good tips on project flow and how I can properly use Reagent since I was doing
some things wrong.

During the meeting my project encountered some build issues that needed to be resolved so that's what I
focused on for the rest of the day. It took some playing around, but eventually I got things working okay.
I seem to be dealing with an issue where the project sometimes compiles wrong and doesn't see certain files
when it should. I found a workaround by using the dev build and the script in my dev project to get it to
properly see my TicTacToe files and everything seems to work just fine!
