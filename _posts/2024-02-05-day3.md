Day three was easily my most productive day yet. I find that the more I know, the more I can learn
the next day. Today I got a much firmer hold on Clojure and solved problems from scratch. Today was also good exposure
for test driven development.

First, I had a meeting with Gina where she gave me a full weeks-worth of tasks to do today. The main focus of this week
is integrating test driven development into my clojure code. I am still working on assigning myself the right amount of
time
for these projects, however I was able to get a days worth of work done today so I'm still on track!

The next thing I focused on was the Euler problems I was assigned. This was my first chance to make Clojure code from
scratch.
It really emphasized the improved grip I have on this language. I am still looking up documentation, but I am starting
to
become fairly self-sufficient with the language now. The next major area this project gave me practice on is test
driven development. For each problem, I would usually make a helper function and then make tests for the helper function
and
the main function. I feel as though I learned a lot on fully testing my functions to make sure they work in every way
possible.

The last thing I did today was take a look at the Clojure Kata I have to perfect this week. By Friday, I am to present
my progress
on it to everyone else, so I will need to look at this at least once a day until then. Day one I unfortunately
misunderstood the
instructions and practiced it in Java instead of Clojure, so I'll have to go back and change that mistake tomorrow.
However following
the slides and understanding the thought process was still very good conceptual practice. It'll be all the better taking
that
knowledge into tomorrow, with more practice and the right language.
