Going into today I got started on a new story that I anticipate to be pretty tricky. I have to
refactor Epic to be able to give project updates to users not currently present in a project. Greg
found this coupling last week because it interfered with the weekly page being able to receive push
updates because users in the weekly page aren't actually in projects.

I found one route to take would be to remove the unique property from connection-id's on members, but
I wasn't sure if this was feasible, I ended up speaking to Brandon about it to see what he thinks.
Brandon told me that a temporary solution is to store unique connection-id's on users in the db, then
have members have non-unique connection-id's on their entities. By doing this I'm able to link a member
to a user, then send push updates to all of that user's connections.

Brandon left me with a pretty involved list of steps that I can follow to achieve this outcome, so
I started following it step by step. By the end of the day I got through most of them but still had a lot
of work ahead of me, I'm incidentally a bit behind on this story. I'll work on it for a bit tomorrow,
but I should prioritize my other story in the meantime.
