Today was a great day for me. I feel confident in the growth I've made in the last week at Clean Coders.
I have newfound confidence in my ability to do well in this apprenticeship and in my skills as a developer.

To start, I demonstrated my Kata to Gina this morning. I did really well conceptually, and she gave
me great feedback on how to better follow the TDD method. One big mistake was that I would write
production code before making a failing test which is strictly against TDD. From both Gina and
Bob Martin Videos I watched later in the day, I got a lot more clarity on the order and style of TDD.

The next thing I did was attend my second company IPM. I was particularly invested in the work that
Brandon was doing with verifying AWS information. I have a huge interest in cloud-based development
so it is something I hope to be involved in down the road with Clean Coders.

After the IPM, I watched both videos on TDD from Bob Martin. Needless to say I was pretty in love with
the method after fully understanding it. I want to keep practicing my TDD until it is second nature to me.
I can tell that this will be the biggest factor in upping the quality of my work from college level to
professional level.

I finished off the day with a huge win while cleaning up Euler 5. As I mentioned earlier in the week, it was
very inefficient and had over a minute run-time on finding all integers divisible by 1-20. After some research
I found out that I make use of Prime Factors to find a solution that only runs has to run through each integer
1-20 instead of brute-forcing checking until the solution is found.
