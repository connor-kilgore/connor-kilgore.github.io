I have to finish off my iteration today. To do so I completed three things. The first was
my spike research on ClojureScript. I looked at some videos on the topic and found the transfer over
to ClojureScript from my original Clojure TTT code was not super complicated. I did however have to
factor in the extension of behavior so that my code would display as a web-ui, that along with considering
any complication made me put my Clojure Script story at 4 points for next week.

For the second half of my day, I started by finishing off my Clojure Con research. I had everyone's
responses for my Google form and was able to do some rough calculations on flight costs and
chart everyone's availability for the event.

Finishing off my day, I ran through my presentation just a few more times to get ready for my IPM
Tomorrow!
