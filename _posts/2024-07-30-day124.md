Today is day two, and the last day of implementation of the first step of Aesop.
I put a lot of effort into getting three features working properly. Fetching all issues,
creating new issues in bulk format, and editing a single issue.

Fetching issues wasn't all that difficult since I'd mostly finished it up yesterday,
however I needed some better tests for it which took longer. I was able to use epic and poker
as guides since I was effectively doing the same thing as them, just for a different API.

By about midday I had some good tests set up, and I started a new test library to simulate
Jira and Epic entities. With a better foundation I could focus more on the new features.

Naturally the rest of the day was dedicated to creating and editing. I was hoping creating wouldn't
be as tricky, it did take a little while to get it working how I'd hoped. Editing took
even longer, but I managed to get everything done and tested by around 5pm. I figured this
was plenty to constitute a solid barebones step-1 for Aesop, so I pushed to a repo and handed it off
to greg to get started on step 2.
