Today, I simply picked up where I left off. My main goal was to finish off a GUI and then practice and
revise a presentation. Additionally, I aimed to reach a good stopping point with a kata, so I could
practice and record it for a video tomorrow.

Finishing my Tic Tac Toe GUI took longer than expected, but I managed to complete it by about
three-quarters of the way into the day. I encountered some unexpected difficulties regarding how
it handled the end of the game, and there were some tests that could have been implemented or improved.

With some time remaining in the day, I was able to revise my kata and practice my dialogue a few times.
I still need to practice my presentation more before I'm ready to showcase it at IPM, but fortunately,
I have tomorrow to run through it several more times. Additionally, I plan to complete and post my kata
video tomorrow.
