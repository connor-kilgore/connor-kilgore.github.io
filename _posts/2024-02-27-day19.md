I made incredible progress today. I got my Tic Tac Toe project working great! The algorithm to be unbeatable is working
as expected, all I have left to do is to clean up my formatting and connect the game into a re-playable loop. As I'm
nearly
done with the project, reflecting back I found TDD to be invaluable on keeping my project robust. More times than I can
count
I made changes that broke older tests, and I was able to go back and fix the issues. I'm very happy with the state of my
code, and it's ability to resist bugs. Putting TDD into practice on a larger scale is very rewarding. I also tried my
best to
follow the SOLID principles I've learned in depth so far and put those into good practice as well. I took approaches I
normally
wouldn't for the sake of good design and that lead to my architecture feeling much more professional.

On the second half of my day, I put some extra effort into getting my LSP presentation together. I did a bit more
research, then put my
slides together. Last week, I was advised to make my presentations less meta and more entertaining. I took this to heart
and had fun with
my presentation this week. I'm feeling pretty confident about my dialogue and the slides. I want to add a bit more
content and practice more,
but it is overall a fairly visual and captivating presentation, while also being informative on the subject at hand.
Here's a sneak peek of
what I mean. Don't worry it's animated so it doesn't look like this all at once.
