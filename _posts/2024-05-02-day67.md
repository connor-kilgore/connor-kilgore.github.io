I was very happy with how my IPM ended today! I don't think I've had an IPM with fewer comments than this one.
I feel as though I really impressed Gina and Micah today!

My IPM was pushed to the afternoon so after that and Lunch, I only had time to watch a few more
clean code videos in the rest of the day, therefore that is what I did.
