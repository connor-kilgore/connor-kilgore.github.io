I was pretty happy with how my IPM turned out. Micah had stacked meetings, so he never ended up coming.
Because of this, I didn't show my presentation, I'm going to do that during Lunch and Learn tomorrow.
I was really confident in how my tests were structured, they were super involved and covered every line
of code to my knowledge.

Afterward, I was given a new task to combine my tic-tac-toe and HTTP_Server libraries together
into a new project to make a web-based ttt game. It doesn't seem too tricky given that I've already
implemented the two libraries, I just need to put them together.

I also had two Clean Code videos to watch today, so that's how I ended my afternoon. The videos were
on advanced test driven development. I felt with the momentum I had, I wanted to jump right into more
TDD concepts!
