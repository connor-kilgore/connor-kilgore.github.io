Today I talked to Micah about helping me update the Fresh library, so I could get the Speclj bug, but I ended up
finding out that I was not taking the right approach to follow the acceptance criteria. This was very unfortunate
since that put me back to square one with only a day left to complete this story.

At midday, I participated in a discovery meeting with some craftsmen. Normally these meetings are not for apprentices
but, I was the one who introduced the potential client, Susan. I did volunteer work for her before I started this
job to keep my skills sharp as a developer while I was looking for a job. This meeting ended up being a huge
learning opportunity for me to shadow how craftsmen communicate with clients and talk about pricing and potential
ideas for them. After the meeting I paired with all the craftsmen, and we estimated everything involved in Susan's
needs to get a rough idea of what kind of pricing she is looking at.

Back to my Speclj problem, I was supposed to integrate a whole new library as Fresh is deprecated. I spent the rest
of the day on this but didn't even come close to a solution. I tried pairing with Alex but there just wasn't enough
time, so I ended up giving the heads-up to my stakeholders before IPM tomorrow.
