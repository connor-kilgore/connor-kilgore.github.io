Going into today I wanted to finish up the todo story but ended up running into a bunch of setbacks.
I found there was a lot to rework in how Epic communicates todos to poker and those needed to be addressed.

For starters, todos on poker don't have anything that connects them to their Epic story, so I had to rework
the database to allow an attribute :super-story that will fix that issue. This took most of the day
because there was a lot of refactoring I had to do to make this possible and work on Poker's end.

By the end of the day I also had to refactor how the todos number is calculated to just be based off how
many todos are linked to the same super-story, by doing this, any updates on Epic can update the numbers
on Poker without making a bunch of unnecessary expensive invocations. Ending today I had fixed a lot of stuff
and that was satisfying, but I've got a lot more to do tomorrow.
