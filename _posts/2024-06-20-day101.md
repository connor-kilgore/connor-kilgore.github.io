My speclj bug story wasn't progressing as quickly as I'd hoped, I decided to back burner it today
and focus on another story for IPM tomorrow.

The story I picked up was on infrastructure. This is where we can access all the AWS instances
and make any changes to them as needed. I brought up the concern last week however that we can
execute commands without any form of confirmation. Those commands can extend to more dangerous ones
like termination and stopping of instances that could lead to major issues. I suggested that commands
that change the state of instances should include some form of confirmation that will prevent any
unintentional state changes.

This story actually wasn't very difficult at all. I created a function that would run a passed along
invocation through a confirmation that would stop the invocation unless the user confirms said invocation.
By the end of the day I had this finished and ready to present for tomorrow.
