I started this morning off by finishing up the top bar design implementation that I had nearly
finished last Friday. It was fun to get to do my first interaction with sandboxes to see
how that works as a developer. The whole process was actually quite simple, I just had to inject
the HTML that was provided for me into the page and have the buttons behave the way they should.
Since the "weekly" button didn't actually go anywhere yet, I had it just route back to projects
for the time being, I will hotfix that later in the week once Greg has finished the barebones
weekly page.

The second half of the day I got started on the route checking story. This story has an issue
where each project has their own route-checking functions that should probably just exist
in c3kit-wire. Additionally, they don't even behave the intended way, therefore I started
this project by just playing around with Epic's route checking function and getting it to behave
as it should. It took a little while, but by the end of the day it was working as intended!
Tomorrow I just need to move this function to the proper project then update each project
that uses this feature.
