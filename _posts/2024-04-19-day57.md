Today wasn't too bad, but I spent a lot of time on something I wished I hadn't. I focused on
two things today, my presentation for Lunch and Learn (L&L), and being able to implement jar files into a
clojure project.

First, I did some last practice on my presentation before L&L. I feel good about how the presentation went,
and I could tell I hit all the points I missed a few weeks ago. The rest of L&L was also enjoyable. I
always like observing the work that the craftsmen do, it lets me look ahead and also explore interesting
concepts.

For the rest of the day, I worked on getting my jar files to be implemented into my clojure project. This
was much more difficult than I'd anticipated. The Tic Tac Toe file wasn't too bad, but it did take over
an hour, where I expected it to take 10 minutes. The HTTP_Server however took much longer. Getting Java
files to work with Clojure files is pretty tricky. First I needed to build a jar file, then I had to
place it into my project and make it findable. After lots of research I found there was some
interaction I had to do with the maven repository for this to work. This made me have to do an additional
step that was hard to find the answer for. After lots of trial and error however, I managed to make the
libraries work within my project.
