Today ended up being a pretty long day incidentally. My suspicions yesterday about the tic-tac-toe
implementation were true. I had a lot of breakdown to do. Fortunately I at least didn't get stuck
on something for too long, it was just a lot of individual steps to get to my desired behavior.

Following the same strategy, I didn't let the tic-tac-toe program run standalone, it had
to have all the necessary extended behavior for my web server. This included generating html
pages, and processing POST requests. It was a lot of work, but I did manage to get the whole
project completed by the end of the day with tests for tomorrow. I still feel like there's a lot
of room for improvement given my time constraints on this project. I would like the chance to go
back and fix those issues I had.

After reflecting on this week. I've realized I need to get some clarification on how I might approach
estimating a project I don't fully understand. This project was new for me. In concept, it sounded
not too bad. But in reality, I took nearly twice as long on it as I'd estimated. Perhaps it is something
I will bring up at IPM tomorrow.
