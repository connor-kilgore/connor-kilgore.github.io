Today I got to work on a research project for Clojure Con for the company. I'm more than happy to do
this work since it's officially the first work I'm doing that provides gain for the company since I
started.

Micah is interested in flying the company out to Virginia this fall to go to Clojure Con as a group.
To do so, he needs to preliminary questions answers which he entrusted me to get answered. Mostly these
questions are about the estimated cost range and the availability of our group.

To get started on this assignment, I started looking into each question to get answered, to find out
what I need to ask of my colleagues for my research. After about an hour, I came created a Google form
to send out to everybody that I'll come back to on wednesday to finish off this story.

To end off my day, I watched another clean code video.
