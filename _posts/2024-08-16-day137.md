I started this morning with a last minute finish on one of my stories. I'm quite happy I got that done since
it was really down to the wire. I didn't want to fall short on the week I'm supposedly getting my final challenge
so it's great that I didn't. It was a story to get an AWS instance set up for Aesop, I worked on it a bunch
yesterday but hadn't had much luck with the approach I was taking. In the morning I tried a simpler route
and got it ready to go just in time for Lunch and Learn!

As for Lunch and Learn, it was enjoyable as always. I got to listen to a few presentations, then we started
our Friday fun time. This week we played another Jensen classic, catchphrase. The team I was on ended up not
doing so great, we just weren't very lucky with the timer.

Afterward we had our IPM, everything was presented without issues and I moved onto my challenge. I'm
not supposed to discuss it, so I'll just leave it at that. Needless to say I have a lot of work cut out for me this
week.
