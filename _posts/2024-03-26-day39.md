Today was almost entirely dedicated to finishing up my 3x3x3 board. I needed to get it to
a good enough spot to be acceptable. This was the part of the 3x3x3 project that I anticipated
being the hardest. It took me a very long time of researching, refactoring, and tinkering, but by
mid-afternoon, I had an AI that was smart but not unbeatable. Unfortunately, I doubt that meets the
acceptable criteria, but I have other things I need to focus on before my IPM.

I spent the next few hours implementing the GUI portion of the 3x3x3 board. It wasn't compatible
with the 3x3x3 due to its unique nature of having multiple layers. Therefore, I had to give the
GUI additional functionality to handle that. It wasn't too hard, and I like how it looks!

I finished the day off by practicing my kata a few times. Along the way, I ended up polishing
some code as well, which made me feel good about my progress with this story. Plus, I still have
tomorrow to practice more.
