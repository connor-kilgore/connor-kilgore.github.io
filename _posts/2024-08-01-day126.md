Starting today I got working on a spreadsheet to put together for Tadd. This spreadsheet was a compilation
of the research I did on Clojure Conj a few months ago. It wasn't really all that difficult to put together
from the research I had already done. Around the time I'd finished the spreadsheet, I got into a
pairing with Tadd to go over the work I've done and make edits based on his own understanding of
what the trip will cost and make adjustments accordingly. This side of the job can be pretty fun sometimes
to plan and organize trips for other people. This could be something I revisit in the future to
speak or meet with clients when I'm a craftsman.

In the afternoon I did some finishing touches on the story I worked on yesterday to fix frontend lag with
the tags. Like I said the solution I found was decent, but I figured there was some more work to be done
so that's what I focused on.

To finish the day I paired with the other apprentices to push some things on infrastructure, from there
I was able to better test my changes and see how they perform in a non-local environment. They worked as
I'd hoped, so I ended the day there.
