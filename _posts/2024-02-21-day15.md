Today was a last day of polishing for me. I started my morning with stand up and then jumped into my last few
Uncle Bob videos for the week. These finished my module on the SOLID principles, which I found to be a very insightful
practice. I like how it is emphasized that these principles are not followed dogmatically, but rather
a set of guiding principles that make your code much more readable and bug free. I still find the Liskov Substitution
Principle to be confusing, therefore I intend to go over it in more depth on my next iteration.

To polish up the last few things for tomorrow's IPM, I focused on practice. I went over my OCP presentation quite a few
times to get the dialogue fully down, and I practiced my coin changer kata a handful of times again to make sure I'm
prepared tomorrow.
