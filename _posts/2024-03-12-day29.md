For today, I had HashMap work to do. As I found out last thursday, I had a misunderstanding of HashMaps,
therefore part of my training is going to be relearning and demonstrating my understanding of this
data structure.

I found out very quickly into development that I have gone through HashMaps in depth, as a Java
implementation no less, I just needed the refresher. Therefore, I'll be taking this project
as a well needed review of the subject so that I have it fully understood, and don't forget about
it's bit and pieces in the future again.

By the end of the day, I had this HashMap in a good spot, working as I'd hoped. Tomorrow I'd like to
clean up a few sections, but all in all I like how it turned out. One of my favorite moments was I
got to use the dependency inversion principle effectively while implementation a getString() method
for my objects that are stored in the map. It gave me a much deeper understanding of using interfaces
through learned experience, it was a huge standout for me today!

I also enjoyed my process of TDD. I found at certain points, I was getting ready to make an implementation,
then realized through my logic it was already implemented. All I had to do was plug in the functions from
my lower level classes to my upper level classes, and everything fit like a glove.
