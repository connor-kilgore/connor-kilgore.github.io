Starting today, I'm jumped into the story to consolidate Micah's users. I got a little started with Gina in
the morning during our weekly pairing. She got me started with a spec file that can ensure that my script
will migrate as needed. We worked on it for about an hour then I moved onto my own work later on.

The rest of the day I spent getting this to a usable spot and I feel as though I nearly got there.
In the morning I'm going to reach out to brandon for some quality assurance and then get this deployed to
production.
