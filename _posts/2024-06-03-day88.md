I had one focus in mind and that was finishing the improved testing story for ClojureScript. I was
quite successful with this story and felt good with the work I finished.

The first thing I focused on in this testing story was the menu navigation. I needed to ensure that
the right options were rendering under the right contexts. Afterward, I went into testing the game-board
making sure that it looks as expected depending on the board size and where certain tokens have been placed.

At the end of the day I did some work on testing simulated button clicks and got it working! However, it only seemed
to rehash what my other tests did. I suppose it at least showed that clicking buttons do their correct function.
After I had these buttons tested I had around 400 lines of tests lined up to my 280 lines of production, so I had
a much better ratio going forward.
