I did two things today. First I decided to get a small win in after the last two days, by completing a
story I knew would be a quick implementation. This story was for the different types of confetti to be
random when an iteration is signed. All I had to do was store the confetti in a list and have rand-nth
do its thing.

Afterward I ended up pairing with Brandon to see if we could conclude this spike story I've been stuck on for
so long. Needless to say he is a life-saver and I learned a ton about how reagent actually works. We found out
that updating a single story causes all currently rendered story-cards on the users page to also rerender,
which causes usually around 250ms of delay each time. The reason for this, is because reagent components re-render
when a ratom or r-tracker are updated that exist within that component. There is a lot of room for coupling due to
this, and there were ratoms in the story modal that existed within the component for story cards creating that
re-render issue.

After working with Brandon for a little while we had reduced the lag to only 80ms, which is where we decided
to mark the story as complete and I created another story for next week to investigate and get rid of the rest of
the lag we are dealing with. I'm still pretty behind on progress this week but I feel good getting this story
done!
