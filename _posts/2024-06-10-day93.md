I had a fairly long weekend due to traveling and meeting family. I'm spending this week at my parents house to
celebrate my younger brother's graduation. To work I am using a laptop which I spent Sunday getting properly
ready for me to develop on without wasting time today.

By the end of the day I had this spinner finally working properly, I'm proud of this one since I managed
to get it finished myself showing I can do these stories autonomously. It's also noticeable how much easier
I can navigate through Epic's architecture without spending lots of time trying to comprehend what everything
is doing.
