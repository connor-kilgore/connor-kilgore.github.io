I was quite delighted with how well my IPM went today. Everything was accepted and I got a lot
of good feedback from my mentors. I appreciated that they took the time to tell me my work is
satisfactory and that I'm doing well. It gave me a good point of reference for my performance so far.

By the end of the IPM, we planned my next iteration where I got a bunch of new stuff to estimate,
I'm set on material for the next two and a half weeks. An upcoming assignment is a 3x3x3 board.
I originally estimated it pretty high due to the weight of my pessimistic guess. When I did the 4x4
board last week, I took well over the amount of time I estimated, I didn't want to make the same mistake.
However, on some reflection I realized the big setback for the 4x4 is shared with the 3x3x3, being
computation time. I think my AI can already handle a 3x3x3 board in terms of time because of the depth
limit imposed on it, so this assignment may not be as bad as I estimate. I'll likely lower my estimation
before being assigned it in the coming weeks.

I finished off my day by adding more tests into my tic-tac-toe board that were lacking. I felt
good at the end of the day about that milestone because I covered a lot of functions that were otherwise
untested, giving me new confidence in my suite.
