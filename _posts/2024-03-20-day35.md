The finalizing touches took a while today, but looking back, I'm proud of the work I've done this week
and more than ready to show what I've accomplished to my mentors tomorrow.</p>

I started today by finishing work on my presentation. I ended up revising a good bit of the information
and dialogue, which meant I had to practice some new lines and spend time creating new slides. As a result,
this took me a little over half the day. Fortunately, I was pleased with how my presentation turned out.

Afterward, I spent most of the rest of my day recording, voicing over, and editing my kata video on
Langton's ant. I was really happy with how this video turned out, especially with how much cleaner my
approach to the problem is compared to last week! I think it's very well explained and readable, which
were both issues I had last week.

I finished my day off by running through everything once more to ensure I am ready for the IPM tomorrow.
I also spent some time on my Tic Tac Toe assignment setting up some tests that could have existed but
I didn't make earlier on. It's challenging to set up tests when using a library that displays a GUI; I'd
like to ask about the best approach to that when I get the chance next.
