To start off today, I had a plan of finishing my abstract factory presentation. If I can do that, I'm
in a good spot to get my ClojureScript project done tomorrow, and finish my last presentation on Wednesday
in time for IPM.

I am noticing I'm a bit behind due to the push on my last IPM, I still have 10 points of work this week
but effectively 8 points of time because I lost a whole day. I will remember if this happens in the future
so that I can bring it to my mentor's attention ahead of time.

Throughout the day, I put my slides together with the research I compiled. I used lots of graphics to
get across my point and I like the flow of my dialogue. I ended the day by running through it quite a few times
till I could get through the presentation without following my script. I'll continue to practice
as the week progresses.
