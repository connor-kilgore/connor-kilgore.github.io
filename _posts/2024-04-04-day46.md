Today, I entered my IPM fairly confident about the work I had to deliver. However, I realized that
I need to do some rework on my Component Design presentation. I missed some principles that are
involved with the presentation, so when I am given the chance again, I'll go back and conduct more
in-depth research on the subject for next time!

At the end of the meeting, I was assigned a significant task: setting up an HTTP server in Java from
scratch. They allotted me the entire week to complete this project. When they say "from scratch,"
it entails using server sockets and managing client intake to the fullest extent possible. Given my
experience with server sockets, I'm optimistic about breezing through this project. While my experience
mainly involves TCP connections, I'm uncertain how much it'll differ with HTTP. However, I am familiar
with byte reading and multi-threading to handle separate client connections.

I dedicated the afternoon to conducting some refresher research and reacquainting myself with the
material. By the end of the day, I successfully set up a basic Java EchoServer that simply prints
out any input received from clients.
