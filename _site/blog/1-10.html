                Welcome, this blog will serve as a log that I will update each work day
                for my apprenticeship at Clean Coders over the coming months. Eventually this will be archived into my portfolio
                after the conclusion of my apprenticeship. Here I intend to share my thoughts working at Clean Coders, and express
                what I have learned and struggled on in detail.

   I started off my day with again going through my Euler problems. I said I was finished yesterday but there was still
   some touch up that needed to be done so that's exactly what I did. I am pretty happy with how all my problems turned out.
   they are highly optimized, I removed unnecessary looping, and I was able to make my tests look great. I am still
   a little unsure on the wording of my test comments, so I'll be sure to bring that into my IPM tomorrow.</p>
  <p>
   The second half of my day I finalized my presentations for tomorrow. I have both my Kata and my SRP presentation.
   For the kata I practiced it a few more times, though I'm more than confident in my ability to write it out
   fluidly. My SRP still needed some memorization finished up. I ran through my script four more times fully until I was
   familiar with the flow of my slides, the dialect, and the content I was presenting. Tomorrow I will ready for my IPM.</p>

  <p>
   Today was a huge day of prep for me. I was able to finish off my Euler Problem's for the week and that
   left me with just preparing for my SRP presentation and Prime-Factors kata.</p>

  <p>
   In the morning, while working on my Euler problems, I finished cleaning the last few problems. I noticed
   how much more elegant my code style has become since last week. Last week I took much weaker approaches to
   problems that were a product of my inexperience with Clojure. Coming back to these problems with a
   noticeably heightened comfort with the language allowed me to come up with more efficient solutions. I also
   am more used to following the practices I'm being taught at Clean Coders with separating functions, having
   involved tests, and following TDD properly.</p>

  <p>
   Afterward, I decided to tackle Euler 11, a problem I haven't looked at yet. I wanted to follow TDD and
   practices I've been taught from the beginning this time, instead of having to come back after solving it.
   I was sure to follow everything for proper continued practice.</p>

  <p>
   I had the whole afternoon to practice my presentations I have to have done this week. Because I'm fairly confident in my
   mastery of my kata, I mainly focused on my SRP presentation, as it was what needed most work. I ended up
   making a script for the presentation and went over it a few times to memorize the dialect and how I would integrate it
   into the flow of my power-point. I ended my day by running through the Kata two more times to further deepen my speed and fluidity
   with the exercise.

  <p>
   I spent most of today preparing for my two presentations I have coming up this week. The first one is the
   <b>Prime-Factors Kata</b> I've been practicing over the previous week, and the second is a five minute
   power-point on the <b>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).</b></p>

  <p>
   I started first on the SRP presentation by watching all the Uncle Bob Videos up to the one that covers SRP.
   This ensured that I was caught up on the concepts and able to fully understand the SRP video itself. After I
   finished watching and taking the exam on SRP, I watched it a second time. This time however I created slides as I
   followed along, this way I was able to follow the proper flow of information, and ensure not to leave out any
   crucial details for the presentation. My slides are completely down, tomorrow I will focus on practicing a
   dialogue to follow these slides.</p>

  <p>
   After, I practiced my kata a few more times. I started by cleaning it up even further, first I removed the loop
   in the function in favor of recursion, next I made sure to clean up my tests to only tests what's necessary.
   While practicing from scratch I was sure to follow the rules of TDD. I only made production code after making
   a failing test, and only made an additional failing test after refactoring. Following this process I cut my
   demonstration time down to eight minutes and my code and tests are highly polished. I am confidently ready
   to demonstrate this kata at any time.</p>

  <p>
   Lastly I ended the day by cleaning up a few more Euler problems. I redid some tests in the earlier problems to not
   over test redundant use cases, and make the describe's and it's better written. Once I finished those, I was able
   to tackle a few problems that I haven't cleaned at all yet and make them much more efficient, clean, and have
   good tests.</p>

  <p>
   Today was a great day for me. I feel confident in the growth I've made in the last week at Clean Coders.
   I have newfound confidence in my ability to do well in this apprenticeship and in my skills as a developer.</p>
  <p>
   To start, I demonstrated my Kata to Gina this morning. I did really well conceptually, and she gave
   me great feedback on how to better follow the TDD method. One big mistake was that I would write
   production code before making a failing test which is strictly against TDD. From both Gina and
   Bob Martin Videos I watched later in the day, I got a lot more clarity on the order and style of TDD.</p>
  <p>
   The next thing I did was attend my second company IPM. I was particularly invested in the work that
   Brandon was doing with verifying AWS information. I have a huge interest in cloud-based development
   so it is something I hope to be involved in down the road with Clean Coders.</p>

  <p>
   After the IPM, I watched both videos on TDD from Bob Martin. Needless to say I was pretty in love with
   the method after fully understanding it. I want to keep practicing my TDD until it is second nature to me.
   I can tell that this will be the biggest factor in upping the quality of my work from college level to
   professional level.</p>

  <p>
   I finished off the day with a huge win while cleaning up Euler 5. As I mentioned earlier in the week, it was
   very inefficient and had over a minute run-time on finding all integers divisible by 1-20. After some research
   I found out that I make use of Prime Factors to find a solution that only runs has to run through each integer
   1-20 instead of brute-forcing checking until the solution is found.

   Today was a day of feedback for me. I had my first IPM meeting, and I got good criticism on my work
   from the last week. Initially I was going to have this meeting next Monday so I was a little ill
   prepared for some of the projects they wanted to see. I managed to complete all Euler problems which was
   great, but I'm going to have to go back and redo a lot of them and clean up all of them in terms of
   form, functionality, and testing.
  </p>
  <p>
   I got a lot of clarity during this meeting on how my code should be written to standard. Yesterday I
   was able to knock out a lot of my older problems and clean them up to look much better. It was very
   satisfying work, seeing my work go from basically rambling in code form, to a "well written prose" as
   my mentor describes it.
  </p>
  <p>
   The last thing I did today was find a much cleaner solution for my Kata, <b>Prime Factors.</b> I got rid
   of an entire loop block and instead replaced it with a lazy sequence. Additionally, I was able to memorize
   the kata to the point of being able to demonstrate it in about 13 minutes time. I will continue to prepare
   as I get closer to demonstrating it for real in the following week.

   Today was a continuation of my work from yesterday and the day before. I worked on the same things and
   I'm getting closer to finishing iteration 2. I ended up finishing the last of the Euler problems
   I was assigned, which is great because it leaves plenty of room to practice my Prime Factors Kata and
   watch the rest of the Uncle Bob videos I have assigned this week.</p>

  <p>
   My last few Eulers were quite fun. The 9th one was especially tricky, I had to find three pythagorean
   triples that summed to 1000. I tried a brute force method by checking each of the values of a, b, and
   c. Not only was this incredibly inefficient with an O(n^3) time complexity, it also seemed to not work
   consistently. As a result I took a different approach and after a bit of research I found a much better
   solution at an O(n^2) time complexity.</p>

  </div>

  <p>
   I also watched a few Uncle Bob videos today on the Clean Coders website. Needless to say, his videos
   are great resources. I love the way he breaks down concepts and gives examples of what he means for
   structuring, form, and other good practices. I've been applying these lessons into my Euler problems
   each day. Today I focused a lot on making functions only do one thing. This process involved making many
   smaller functions with their own single purpose, while also using names that were intuitive for reading.</p>

  <p>
   The last thing I worked on today was my Clojure Katas, I mostly spent that time going through the problem
   once again, making sure I understand the concepts, the syntax, and how I would make tests iteratively from
   simple to more complex inputs.</p>

   Day four was a good day, I am starting to become much more capable of working myself. The first few days,
   I needed help with instruction and onboarding, but now I'm in the groove of my schedule. Going forward, I will
   be having weekly monday meetings with Gina to discuss the previous weeks work I did and what I will do the
   following week for my apprenticeship. Overall it is a great system that allows me to learn at my own pace. And
   if I'm ever stuck, I can always reach back out to my mentor for guidance.</p>
  <p>
   I continued what I worked on yesterday. I did Euler problems 5-7, and practiced my Clojure Kata problem.
   Each time I practice this Kata I go through each test and understand how each test makes sure the code I created
   is robust and handles all edge cases. I find this style of test driven development to be incredibly useful
   as I continue to become used to it. I find ways to break my code in ways that I would not have found in the past.
   Ultimately it allows me to find and fix bugs quickly. I also redid my kata today to be in Clojure and changed
   my approach to reference one of my Euler problems and alter it a bit. The code works great, but next I have to prepare
   to present this to everyone else in the company on Friday. Part of that will be deeply learning my process, and then
   practicing how I will convey my thoughts while put in the spotlight. </p>
  <p>
   The Euler problems I did today were somewhat challenging but today more of the challenge was on my approach and the
   concepts, rather than getting Clojure syntax right. One of the problems I found a solution, but it takes incredibly
   long to calculate. It has a O(m*n) processing time, but m gets exponentially larger with each increment of n in my solution.
   There is likely a more elegant and efficient solution that I would like to explore later this week.</p>
  <p>
   I also watched an Uncle Bob video on extracting functions to smaller ones whenever possible. I noticed I could
   follow that process better, so today I was mindful about making sure each function I wrote did only one task and
   was accompanied by a number of tests on that function. I found with this approach, I had much more robust code
   because I was testing smaller crevices of my code instead of just seeing if one or two big functions gave the
   expected outcome. It also made my code much more readable too.

  <p>
   Day three was easily my most productive day yet. I find that the more I know, the more I can learn
   the next day. Today I got a much firmer hold on Clojure and solved problems from scratch. Today was also good exposure
   for test driven development.</p>
  <p>
   First, I had a meeting with Gina where she gave me a full weeks-worth of tasks to do today. The main focus of this week
   is integrating test driven development into my clojure code. I am still working on assigning myself the right amount of time
   for these projects, however I was able to get a days worth of work done today so I'm still on track!</p>
  <p>
   The next thing I focused on was the Euler problems I was assigned. This was my first chance to make Clojure code from scratch.
   It really emphasized the improved grip I have on this language. I am still looking up documentation, but I am starting to
   become fairly self-sufficient with the language now. The next major area this project gave me practice on is test
   driven development. For each problem, I would usually make a helper function and then make tests for the helper function and
   the main function. I feel as though I learned a lot on fully testing my functions to make sure they work in every way possible.</p>

  <div class="row" style="margin: 20px">
   <img src="/assets/photos/euler-1.png" width="150" class="col" />

  <p> The last thing I did today was take a look at the Clojure Kata I have to perfect this week. By Friday I am to present my progress
   on it to everyone else, so I will need to look at this at least once a day until then. Day one I unfortunately misunderstood the
   instructions and practiced it in Java instead of Clojure, so I'll have to go back and change that mistake tomorrow. However following
   the slides and understanding the thought process was still very good conceptual practice. It'll be all the better taking that
   knowledge into tomorrow, with more practice and the right language.</p>

   Today was my second day at the company and also a Friday which means I got to participate in the some interesting
   meetings with the company. We had our morning check in as usual, I had something to say this time, talking about
   the work I did yesterday. However things got really interesting during our Lunch and Learn meeting.</p>
  <p>
   This was certainly a long meeting, lasting just over two hours. During this meeting I got my first real insight into the
   day-to-day of craftsmen and what kind of projects they worked on. First I got to listen to a presentation
   from Gina and how others reacted to it, giving her constructive criticism.
   Next, we went over peoples show-and-tell for the week on what they did and what input other people had.
   The process was reminiscent of my capstone, being able to
   share progress, make suggestions, and come up with new tasks for the following week. Needless to say, I learned a lot by
   listening in, I look forward to the next one. At the end of it, we played <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a> as a
   fun team building exercise which I won.</p>
  <p>
   I didn't finish my Clojure Koans by the time I said I would. As a result, at the start of the day I spoke with Gina and she told me
   to be communicative about if I'm behind on work or not. It left me to reflect on perhaps why I was told to use the poker
   program in the first place to estimate how long this project would take me. Truthfully I had no idea at the time, all I could really
   do was guess, it was my first day and I wasn't given the chance to look at the project more in-depth to get a better estimate. I came to the conclusion
   that perhaps this is some kind of initiation lesson that Clean Coders does. It really emphasizes being transparent with clients and
   colleagues. If I succeed in this apprencticeship, I will likely have to deal with this exact issue, in real scenarios, on much bigger projects, and with
   time and money at stake. All in all, I'm glad to have this hammered in now and not later.</p>
  <p>
   As for my actual project, I could notice the improvement of my grasp on this language today. It took me less time to
   understand new concepts. More often than not I was able to figure out answers from my own deductions without
   extra research or reference. I certainly spent the most time on destructuring. It was a fascinating topic and left me with a
   lot of room to find my own approach for answers. I particularly enjoyed one about putting together a string of all of
   Rich Hickey's nicknames. I could have done an easier more verbose solution, but I wanted to find a way to make my answer more
   sophisticated. the rest of the koans were also interesting but I did not take too long on any
   of them.

  <p>
   Today was my first day at <b>Clean Coders</b>. Admittedly it was an anxious day as is any first day of a new job.
   Fortunately everyone was warm and welcoming during my onboarding process. I met some of my potential future colleagues
   as well as my mentors and bosses.</p>
  <p>
   I spoke mostly with Micah and Gina regarding first steps. Micah purchased a Mac Mini
   for me to use which is exciting. I've never used another OS for software development, but I hope to never go back to Windows,
   It does not have good command line support after all. Gina helped me with getting my first assignments, one of which is
   setting up this very blog. I was assigned to set up a github.io site however I made one years ago so all I had to do was add in this new page.
   Though I'm no expert UX designer, I know how to make it look decent and functional, which is perfect for this ongoing project. Gina also
   helped me navigate to other applications I'd need for this apprencticeship such as Tuple, IntelliJ, Epic, and Poker.</p>
  <p>
   My first real challenge was the
   <b>Clojure Koans</b> assignment I was given. It serves as an educational guide for me to become familiar with clojure,
   the primarily used language at Clean Coders. Clojure needless to say is a steep learning curve. It appears to be a less verbose language at the
   expense of it being much harder to read for inexperienced persons. It also uses prefix notation which I'm no stranger to, but will still take some
   getting used to.</p>
  <p>
   In this assignment I had to fill in unit tests and get them to pass by putting in the right code snippets or parameters. I was given 27 clojure
   files each with on average around ten tests in them. I got through 14 at the time of writing this entry and I hope to do a few more before I call it a day.
   Initially it was quite straightforward and easy, I breezed through the first five or six. Then I began hitting tests with answers that needed more
   understanding of the language to apply my prerequisite knowledge of coding. It was a slow trog for a few hours, I spent it really trying
   to learn how to read this code and understand how the interpreter read the language. I basically had an answer key by looking at the koans file but it wouldn't help me
   truly understand, so I used it for reference only.</p>
  <p>
   My aha moment finally arrived on the 14th file, recursion. I know recursion, and I know it well, but that also means I know how tricky it can be,
   especially when learning a new language. I didn't understand fully how loops worked yet and how to pair that with recur in Clojure syntax. It took
   me a good while just researching and examining these tests to understand them, and then it clicked! With that I was able to come up with my own solution
   to <b>recursive-reverse</b> and
   <b>factorial</b> that differed from the answer key. When I am able to splinter off into my own line of thinking and my own
   approach, instead of hugging the examples and given answers, that is when I know I'm beggining to understand at a fundamental level. At that point I stopped
   with a feeling of satisfaction in my mind, and believing I have done enough today to share in this blog post.</p>
