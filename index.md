My name is Connor Kilgore. I am an American software developer. I completed my bachelor's in computer science at 
[Northern Arizona University]("https://www.nau.edu") in May 2023. I am particularly interested in backend development 
and working with database systems. I am most proficient in Java and C. Outside of school work, I am passionate about
my personal computer science related projects. Particularly I like to make games on the platform 
[Roblox]("https://www.roblox.com"). More information on that can be seen in [Projects]("/projects/roblox").
I also have many hobbies, I love to play video games, watch horror movies and anime, read sci-fi fantasy novels, and 
learn about astronomy. Currently I am employed at [Clean Coders LLC.]("https://cleancoders.com/").
