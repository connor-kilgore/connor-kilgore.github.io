    <p>My name is Connor Kilgore. I am an American software developer. I completed my bachelor's in computer science at 
    <a href="https://www.nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in May 2023. I am particularly interested in full-stack development
    and have been exploring with embedded concepts. I am most proficient in Python, Java, and Clojure. Outside of work, I am
    passionate about my personal computer science related projects. Particularly I like to make games on the platform 
    <a href="https://www.roblox.com">Roblox</a>. More information on that can be seen in <a href="/projects/">Projects</a>.</p>

    <p>I also have many hobbies, I love to play video games, watch horror movies and anime, read sci-fi fantasy novels, and 
    learn about astronomy. Currently I am employed at <a href="https://cleancoders.com/">Clean Coders LLC</a>.</p>
